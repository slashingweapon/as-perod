title: Proclamation of Faith
---

All who can hear come forth and know the words of King Oldeaus, Ruler of Aspera by Divine Intent, as spoke by Him on the 48th of Autumn 1146:

MAY THE GODS KEEP US AND GUIDE US.  These words or similar have graced every royal proclamation for nigh on twenty-three centuries, ever since the first Asperan king accepted the divine command to rule from the Yeron to the Hightable, holding by Their Will and not his own the lives and welfare of all who dwell in this land.  

When that very first king of Aspera accepted his great task from the Gods he was given by Them, through the hands of Their priests, three powerful and holy tools to aid his endeavor. One among these being the High Seat, a throne which gave wisdom to him who sat upon it and revealed the lies of any who stood before it.  Though humble in its appearance the High Seat was the used by the highest court in the Land for centuries, until war with the Empire caused it to be lost.

After many generations THE HIGH SEAT HAS BEEN FOUND and returned to its rightful place.  We owe for this deed to Bishop Ambrose, together with his several stalwart companions, who braved danger and darkness to recover what was lost to Us.  From this day forth all who have business with the High Justicar will be heard and judged before the High Seat, and all who attend will know the presence of the Gods is with us.

Now more than any other time it is fitting that the High Seat be returned to Us, for it is now that we have need of it.  We alone have kept to the Gods, while other nations have reduced Faith to mere folklore.  Our people gather at the temples by the tens of thousands while the Principalities have none of their great places of worship left standing.  In Aspera the favor of the Gods is ardently sought by our best Riders and our most dedicated Thanes, while elsewhere the Gods are made into stories for children to be discarded at the first blush of adulthood.  The High Seat has been returned to us, as the Gods no doubt designed, at a most opportune time.

We are thus saddened and yet not surprised to receive from the Arcane Academy an Ultimatum to relinquish the High Seat and renounce Our Gods, else the Arcane Council will remove itself from Us.  We have always known through Our centuries of association with the Arcane Council that they do not recognize the Gods as we do and would rather declaim Them than worship Them.  In so many generations of friendship We have never thought to force upon another Our Faith, choosing instead to demonstrate through patience and friendship the wisdom of honoring the Gods.

It is for the sake of Our Faith that We expel the Arcane Council from Our Lands, and order them to quit the kingdom by the next full moon.  Those arcanists who are not in the employ of the Council and desire to remain in Aspera may swear Fealty to the Throne, thus regaining our protection and friendship individually.  We further command that the denizens of Aspera will demonstrate the Regret with which we take this action, by in no way harassing nor hindering arcanists in their exodus.  All must allow them to pass without interference, upon our grievous Displeasure.

It remains Our fervent Hope that the Arcane Council will consider their consciences deeply and in time conclude that it has asked of Us what can not be rightfully given, for We belong to Our Gods and can no more give them up than we could relinquish the blood of our bodies or the air of our lungs.  We further Hope to one day embrace the Arcane Council as a Friend and Ally whose Amity, Courage, and Purpose may again be united with Our own.

May the Gods keep Us and guide Us.
