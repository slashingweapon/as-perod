title: Secrets of the Grave
---

This is a codex the size of two spellbooks (200 pages), tightly bound.  The original edition of this book has hefty linen pages inscribed with good ink and color illustrations.  The excellent construction means that an original copy of the book, if well-kept, will last for hundreds of years.

The original author was Hero Janicus, a human mage who was censured by the Academy and, when he wouldn't stop his pursuit of certain studies, hunted by the Academy for years.  They never found him, but copies of his book started popping up in unexpected places.

The first two-thirds of the book is full of necromantic theory, a compendium of common undead, death-related esoterica, and information on the plane of shadow.  The second half of the book is full of spells not commonly available to Academy arcanists.   Some of them he invented himself.

Consulting this book on any matter relating to the undead gives a +4 circumstance bonus to find such knowledge.  Consulting it on matters of the plane of shadow gives a +2 circumstance bonus.

An arcanist who reads the book will recognize that most of the necromancy spells are of the kind that would be restricted by the academy.  The same person would also recognize that much of the planar information is counter to Academy teachings.  The academy position is that everything outside the veil and outside the Prime Material plane is just chaos, so the assertion of any kind of planar order or the suggestion that there are non-hostile creatures beyond the veil is anathema.  Curiously, Hero was only interested in calling demons because he wanted to learn about undead.  Yet he mentions briefly a few other types of outsiders.
