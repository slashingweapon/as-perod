# History 

[Ghaucia](Ghaucia.html), commander of the Tenth Imperial Army, lead the fight on the plains of [Releven](Releven.html) for two seasons.  The forces of Releven were skilled and ferocious, raised from birth to fight and win battles on the open plains and rolling hills of their homeland.  The most renowned of these was the Kretian charioteers, who drove the finest horses known to mankind and barded them in white.  The Kretians were admired and imitated from the East Barrier to the far Western Sea, and were aided by the best magicians in Releven.

At the begining of the third season the Emperor himself took charge of the Releven campaign.  It was well-known in the army that the Emperor's advisors were calling for [Ghaucia](Ghaucia.html)'s head.  Upon the Emperor's arrival, Commander Ghaucia presented himself for judgement.  After the full official account of the campaign was read to all assembled the Emperor drew his sword and called Ghaucia forward to pass judgement.  As was customary, Ghaucia approached the Emperor's seat and knelt to receive his due whether it was for good or ill..

With a sure stroke the Emperor severed the Commander's insignia from Ghaucia's armor.  "With your Army you have occupied Our most skilled enemy on his own homeland for two years.  There is nothing but honor in your service in this land, and for that honor I raise you to the rank of Marshal.  This is the year you finish the halflings, for I am here to put my hand to the matter personally."  In this one stroke the Emperor both preserved and promoted his best Commander, and enabled his own eventual victory over Oryus.

The campaign lasted only half a season longer.  The end was especially brutal for the famed Kretian Charioteers, which Ghaucia and the Emperor pursued relentlessly.  The fighting became so costly on both sides that the Emperor spent part of his own spirit to break their mages' power and thus open a way to victory.  His gambit proved to be well-timed, and the Tenth Army gained a decisive upper hand.  Of over nine hundred Kretians only two hundred and thirty six survived, all of them so badly wounded they could not not fight.  Thus were they defeated with perfect honor.

Deprived of their chariot forces, the halfling forces began to fail and fall.  When the tide had turned completely, King Ortian VI surrendered to the Emperor in person with these words:

> "The free nation of Releven is no more.  We have been mastered in arms, magic and spirit, and beg the Red Emperor to take us into his bosom as a father embraces a lost son.  We pray the father will look upon his son, and find a face not unlike his own.  We hope the father will look into the eyes of his son, and recognize his own spirit."

The Emperor gave Ortian VI an honorable death.  To [Releven](Releven.html) he gave a fair rule under the king's son, Ortian VII.  For the Kretian Charioteers he built a monument upon the site of their last battle, and suffered no ill word to be said of them.  The surviving Kretians begged to serve the Emperor rather than be disbanded, so they were given the standard of a white horse rampant on a field of red, and called the White Guard.

In modern times, the White Guard is comprised of 236 halflings and their distinctive bear mounts.  Only doughty halfling warriors who have distinguished themselves either in combat or in the tri-annual Great Games of [Releven](Releven.html) are elegible to join, and they must wait for an opening.  The Great Prince of [Soubous](Soubous.html) pays a fortune for their arms and upkeep, and makes frequent use of them.  When there are no wars to fight, he often loans small detachments out to the [Academy](Academy.html).
