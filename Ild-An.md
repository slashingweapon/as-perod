title: Ild-An
---

Once a large mountain range rising from the East Ocean over 600 miles in length, Ild-An is now little more than a string of jungle-covered islands strewn across the water.  Some time during the late tenth century there were massive undersea earthquakes which sank the land and left only the mountaintops above water.  The same earthquakes caused huge floods in Ild-Eldir and Releven, destroying major cities.
