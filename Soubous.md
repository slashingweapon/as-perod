title: Soubous

The Principality of Soubous is the greatest of the seven kingdoms.  It once ruled over all the seven kingdoms and beyond, and even in decline it remains the wealthiest kingdom.  Although it is thought of as a single nation, it is actually the remaining core of the Empire.  The ruling state of Arducia and its capitol (the city of Soubous) rule several client states, which were themselves constructed from the thirty-odd stone-throw states conquered by [Mosyph](Mosyph.html).

The seven realms of Soubous are wildly diverse, and traveling from one to the other can be a bit of a shock to anyone with a provincial mindset.  What they all share in common is tribute to Great Prince of Soubous and a requirement to fight when he calls.  They also maintain alliances with each other through a network of marriages and treaties, which means all the noble families are related to each other.  That doesn't prevent them from fight among themselves, which the Grand Prince allows from time to time.

The other thing they have in common is strong class structures.  People rarely move out of the classes from which they are born unless it is through elevation by someone in a higher caste than themselves.  Losely speaking, the classes fall along the lines of slaves, farmers, military, tradesmen, landed gentry, and nobles.  In some realms even specific occupations are inherited.  The status of artists and entertainers varies from one realm to the next, as does attitudes towards women.  One of the few ways to break out of one's class is to be picked up by the Academy.

Of all the cities and all the realms of the empire of Soubous, these are the four greatest.  The first is the [City of Soubous](Soubous(City).html) in the heart of Arducia, where the Great Prince makes his throne.  The second is [Khum-Khari](Khum-Khari.html), the city of towers and the exclusive realm of the Arcanasts and those who serve them.  The third is [Blackwater](Blackwater.html), famed for its deep water port, shipyards, and powerful navy.  The fourth is [Kepharix](Kepharix.html), which guards the strait of Tarbiya.
