title: Rest for the Weary
---

From the Great Road, heading north between [Oxhed](Oxhed.html) and [Plover](Plover.html), there is a lane that is clearly marked by a large sign that says "Rest for the Weary" which heads south and slightly uphill, lined with tall poplars.  In a few hundred yards a manor house comes into view, built in the Imperial style.  It is a large white building nearly 200 ft wide, three stories tall, with a roof the color of patinated bronze.   Additional wings of the house extend to the rear.

While hte house is fairly old, it has only been in operation as a roadside inn for the last several years.  It has a reputation as the finest road house in all of Aspera.

The house is fronted by a wide expanse of lawn, cropped by miniature sheep.  A paved path wide enough for a carriage circles by the front steps.

# Inn Layout

## Ground Floor

The central wing is nearest the road, and shows a flight of stairs to a pair of large oaken doors, overlooked by neat rows of windows and shutters.  Just past the doors is the great room: rows of wooden tables and a fire pit in the center.  Over the fire pit a large chunk of meat is usually roasting during the day.  At night the tables are cleared back and people sleep on the floors.

Left wing holds the kitchen.  Right wing holds the gaming halls.

## Second floor

The left wing has the expensive salons and suites (2g/night/room. Dedicated servants for 5s a night each.).   Center wing holds the grand staircase, and the "viewing area" for the working girls, presided over by Sedae.  Right wing holds a warren of small, richly appointed rooms for "appointments".

## Third Floor

Top floor center and right wings have smaller private rooms (5s a night).  Left wing holds a kind of servants barracks.

## Other

A dumbwaiter runs from each floor to just outside the kitchen.

## Basement

There's a basement level, too.  On the left (kitchen) side it is used as a celar for holding food, beer, and wine.  On the right side the basement is the "bunker" where the low-class indulge in some uncommon substances.

# Management

Bossang - Proprietor. Exp 10.  Heavy guy, curly gray hair, cheery face.  

Sedae - Madame, Exp 7

Doris - Chief Cook Exp 5

# Outbuildings

Several additional buildings are gathered a little bit down the lane from the main house.  They house some of the staff, offer trades that support the inn, and a few people who just like to live here.
