title: Protean Quartz
---

Protean quartz is a variety of gemstone with useful magical properties.  When a protean crytal is cleaved into smaller pieces, the shards will copy sights and sounds to each other even at a distance of a few feet.  This discovery is recent, but is the subject of intense research by the academy.  Already the protean quartz is widely used in many communication spells.

Like amethyst and citrene, protean is a macrocrystalline form of SiO2 with mineral impurities that give it color and other special properties.  This special quartz is easy to identify from its perfect black color and the way light shimmers in white waves through its depths.  Protean mineral formations are not hard to find, but crystals of sufficient size and perfection for magical uses are rare.

Protean quartz occcur naturally, but can also be grown in an alchemist's lab.  The alchemist must prepare a solution, the value of which is the same as the crystal he wants to grow.  This is a standard craft(alchemy) check DC 25.  Once he has made the solution he can grow the crystal in a container or vat at a rate of 100gp per week.  The quartz crystals require a stable environment for growing, without  earthquakes, loud bangs, high winds, falling debris, or anything else that might vibrate the solution.  Any such disturbance ruins the entire crystal.

**Example** Barnaby wants to make a 900gp protean crystal.  He spends 300gp on materials and takes ten on his craft check to make the solution, giving him a score of 25.  In one week he makes 625gp worth of solution (DC25*SkillCheck25).  On the second week he takes ten again, spending another 18 hours to to come up with 275gp worth of solution.  Alltogether he has 900gp worth of solution.  He puts it in his growth container for nine weeks to let the crystal form.
