=Who I Am and How I Came to Be= 

The first thing I remember is darkness. It was always dark in my room, and I never understood why. I asked mama to light a candle and she said she couldn’t, because master wouldn’t let her. To live in darkness at the whim of another: that is what it is to be a slave.

As a young man I constantly saw the strong overpowering the weak, and swore that I would ally myself with the strongest power I could find so as to never be in that position. I served the master of the house, and as my service pleased him he treated my family better. I worked tirelessly, ensuring that everything in the house was perfect, so that there would be no cause for complaint. But it didn’t help.

When my master had gambling debts he sold my mother and sister to another family. I was enraged, but there was nothing I could do, no power stronger than my master. Until there was, and the man came at night to kill my master – his debts had grown too large, and the shylocks feared he was setting a bad example to others. They came for all his property, and for the first time I fled from the house of my birth – I was a runaway slave, and I was ashamed. I had broken the law, but I found shelter within the temple of Zarus.

On that very day the veil fell and I beheld the power of the All-Mighty, as it flooded the temple once more. The abbot saw my arrival as propitious – a good omen of things to come. As the weeks passed I learned that Zarus was the mightiest of all the gods, stronger even than the gods of the elves, dwarves, even of the gnomes, none of whom could stop the wave of chaos sweeping the land. Only the church of Zarus brought order to our community, and I was proud to stand in their number.

And so it came to pass that the gnomes sought to return to their ancient homeland. I worried for my people, for the wilderness is a dangerous place. Who knows what dark and ancient have lain there, waiting until the fall of the Veil to allow their dark works to prosper. If the gnomes are to build a home in this wilderness we must ally ourselves with the strongest if we are to succeed, and there are none stronger than Zarus. Without his help we are lost; with his help we cannot fail!

=Sermon by the Brenwhite= 
I wash my hands in the waters of the river. I thank Zarus for granting us the wisdom to deal fairly with the fey, then I thank the spirit of the river for his kindness, and finally I thank Zarus once more, from whom all power flows. It has been a trying few days, organizing everything I need in such short a time. But people have heard of the good works of the Mission of Zarus, and today is one which all will long remember.

“Hama Luft, we’re almost ready.” I turn to see Fallon, not much younger than me, yet he is filled with such the vitality of youth. Or perhaps my responsibilities just make me feel old. I hear the murmer of the multitude just over the river bank.

“Good, thank you Fallon. You’ve done well in my absence. I see many clothed in the blue of Zarus, and many bellies full of his mercy.”

He beams at these words, both out of pride for a job well done and satisfaction for the people he is helping to strengthen. “You set a fine example, Hama.”

Hama. Back in Asperod I was an acolyte. Now in the wilderness I am Hama of Zarus, answerable only to our lord. I worried at that, but I feel the force and will of my master, and he has led me to this point. Fallon and I walk up the riverbank, and I behold over 500 souls, all those who have been fed and clothed by the mercy of Zarus. I walk under the canopy and stand atop the dias, and raise my hands in benediction, the splendor of the eagle giving lightness and weight to my words.

“The might of Zarus is our shield!”

//“May we be his sword.”// Many intone the chorus, more every day.

“This is a great day, my friends, for today we break ground on the First Church of Zarus in this new land. I am proud to share this day with you all. Since our arrival in this land I have worried about two things only: doing my best by you all, and serving the will of Zarus. I am here today as a testament to the fact that these two endeavors are one in the same. I serve Zarus by serving the gnomish race.

“Now I have heard some speak of Zarus as a ‘human god,’ and there are certainly gods who look out for a specific race of people exclusively – the elves, the dwarves, the orcs all have their patrons. But I am here to tell you that Zarus is **not** a god of humans, but rather a god who honors power and discipline. There was a time when the humans represented that power, when they had the discipline to conquer and dominate the world. But that time has passed, and we have all lived to see that glorious day.

“But why did the humans fall? Because they were unworthy of support of Zarus. They had grown corrupt, dominating other races for no reason except that they could, squandering the power granted them by Zarus. And so he turned his back on the humans, and their power has broken.

“But whom does he now support? Zarus’ eye turns to us, here, in this land. You want proof? It is self evident – we are here! We have thrown off the human shackles and returned to our homeland! And we have dominated a mighty host of humanity though our force of will and arms. Zarus has shown his pleasure in our works by granting us victory, but the fall of the humans should serve as a lesson to us all: we must always show ourselves as worthy of that support.

“And we must have the wisdom to know when to use the domination of the word rather than the sword. We have allied ourselves in this wilderness with the very spirits or the land. These powerful forces are wild and unpredictable, and yes we must be on our guard, but we must also remember that they have been here for a long time, and we can learn much from them. Zarus teaches that knowledge is power as well.

“But what knowledge do our people employ? Lately I have seen human vices in the actions of the gnomes: greed, selfishness, sloth and mendacity. We were **all** under the boot of the humans, yet there are some in our community who would set themselves up as their replacements. If we are to be worthy of the blessings of Zarus we must not turn our forces against one another. Gnome must not dominate gnome. If we are to conquer this land we must do so as a people, united.

“I have a companion who has a phrase he uses. I would like to paraphrase that for us all here today: ‘Service to the people, Glory to the Race, in Zarus’ name.’ It is up to all of use to help one another out here, to show the strength to set aside our petty concerns for the greater glory of all gnomes. We have the force of Zarus behind us, and a continent to dominate before us. We mustn’t squander our power mastering one another. Rather we must marshal all the forces we have been granted: our minds, our words, our spirits and our swords, to make this land our own.

“It will not come tomorrow, or in our lifetimes, but if we all stay true to the will of Zarus this land will belong to the gnomish people once more. Stand together! Stand as one! Service to the people! Glory to the Race! In Zarus’ name!”
“//Service to the people! Glory to the Race! In Zarus’ name! Service to the people! Glory to the Race! In Zarus’ name! Service to the people! Glory to the Race! In Zarus’ name!//”

The chant rang throughout the assemblage as I consecrated the ground for our new temple, and the words were carried on the lips of those who had received Zarus’ blessing. When I left with my fellowship the next day the phrases were still being repeated in greetings. Fallon was already working at dawn, directing the men digging the foundation. My first official act on the holy site was to imbue him as my Fie, so that he would serve our people with the power of Zarus while I was gone.

We will conquer this land, through word or deed. And with the power of Zarus behind us we will not fail.
