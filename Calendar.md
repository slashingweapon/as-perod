The Imperial Calendar has solar years which are 359 days long, separated into four seasons.  Each moon cycle of the year has a name (although local practices vary widely).

|| Winter || 90 days || Begins at midnight on the winter solstice ||
|| Spring || 90 days || Begins at midnight on the spring equinox ||
|| Summer || 90 days || Begins at midnight on the summer solstice ||
|| Autumn || 89 days || Begins at midnight on the autumn equinox ||

There are two moons in the sky.  The largest is commonly called Luna and has a period of 31 days.  The smaller is named Cato and has a period of 37 days.  Luna is quite large and bright, and when full shines almost bright enough for a human to read by.  Cato is quite a bit smaller and dimmer.  In many mythologies the smaller moon is a familiar of the larger moon, usually some kind of bird or a cat.

The Imperial Calendar begins at about the same time the Emperor Mosyph began his ten year conquest of As-Perod, the same year that the sun and both moons were in alignment at the begining of the new year -- a most auspicious time to begin a conquest.  Such a conjunction will not happen again until New Year's day, 1178.

To figure out the phase of one of the moons simply multiply the year times 359, add the number of days past so far in the current year, divide by the period of the moon you want to know about, and take the remainder.  That will tell you how many days you are into the cycle of that moon.

Moonrise is at about dawn on the New Moon, and at sunset during the full moon, with the moon rising and setting a little later each subsequent day.
