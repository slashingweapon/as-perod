=Vohanis, A Crossroads=

In the heart of the Badlands, sheltered by the winding gorges of the [[Sudag]] hills, lies a crossroads.  The old Imperial Road runs from the Principalities of Soubous in the West to Aspera in the East.  A lesser-traveled road runs north, through the several kinds of wilderness ultimately ending at the irreputable port of Corisat.  An even fainter road heads South towards the heart of the tidal sands, but fades into the desert after only a hundred yards.  

Squatting on this intersection is the city of Vohanis, carved from the rocky sides of the mazed gorges surrounding the crossroads, and blocking the ways with iron gates.  It is the only source of water for nearly a hundred miles in any direction, which makes it an almost mandatory stop on the Imperial Road.  It also extracts a toll from all travelers, and any who bypass the city in hopes of saving a few coin forfeit the "protection" offered by the Master of the City.

Anything can be bought or sold in Vohanis no matter how forbidden it may be elsewhere, any service can be purchased, any pleasure can be had -- if the price is right.

==Culture==

In Vohanis, everyone belongs to someone.  Without an affiliation with one of the guilds, a person and everything they own is fair game.  You have to be very strong, or very stupid, to wander around in Vohanis without the protection of a guild.  Visitors should be accompanied by a guide.  The Hospitalers charge 4s per guide per day, which comes with the guild's protection.

In Vohanis, there is no such thing as a gift between strangers.  Every act incurs a debt, and all debts must be paid.

==Politics==

The city is run by Guilds, which are little more than thinly-disguised gangs.  Every citizen has an affiliation with a guild, which provides protection and valuable resources in exchange for loyalty and "taxes".  A few "independents" remain so only because they are too strong to easily coerce into membership.  The heads of the various guilds are seldom seen, chosing instead to allow petitioners come to them.  Guildmasters are often targets for assassination and other unpleasantness.  Open warfare between the guilds is actively discouraged by the Master.

Ruthlessness and efficiency are the keys to greatness in the City.  Those who can bring in the most money with minimal interference from the other guilds while keeping their own internecine conflicts in check are the people who ultimately succeed.

===Guilds===
A short sampling of the guilds in Vohanis:

**Chislers** Building trades of all kinds.  Also controls the extensive cistern system, and what passes for civic planning.

**Caravaners** Wagonwrights, Inn Operators, Weaponsmiths, Tack and Harness, Mercenaries.  Almost anything directly related to running a caravan is controlled by this guild.

**City Watch** The right to patrol the city, collect tolls and taxes, and impose the Master's will.

**Hospitalers** Inns, cooks, healers, brewers, entertainers.

**Mercantile** Moneylenders, marketplace, common stores.

**Poisoners** Master crafters and administers of poisons of all kinds, they provide a market for those interested in selling dangerous materials or buying finished poisons.  Custom poisons can also be designed, for a significant fee.  Small in number, but greatly feared.  Juttica is the guildmaster.  A flower is their symbol (poisonous flower of course).

**Guild of Shadows** Theives, spymasters, interesting skills of many kinds.

**Black Chain** Slavers.

**Vice** Sex trade, gambling.

===Master of the City===
The Master is chosen by the guildmasters, often from one of their own number.  It is his job to ensure the continued prosperity of all the guilds.  Like a monarch, keeping his position requires that the Master keep his nobles (Guildmasters) happy or else play them off against each other.  Protracted turf wars drive travelers to other routes (like the Yeron-Corisat water route) and could impoversh the city.

==Points of Interest==

===Gates===
Each of the major gates is a weave of thick iron bands in a heavy frame.  These doors are open during daylight hours, and close to all visitors at night.  

To pass through the gates costs a toll, for which the traveler receives seals certifying he is protected by the City Watch during his stay.  He gives up the seals when exiting, or pays 10x the toll (if he is allowed to leave at all).

==Tombs==
As impressive as parts of the city are, it is nothing compared to the City of the Dead.  As you leave the city and head north, there is a small side road that cuts West.  The narrow passage is barely wide enough for a standard cart, a channel cut by the wind over ages.  

A mural is carved on the south side, with grotesque images.  A man who stays after sundown is shown in chains, being eaten by ghouls.  A group of people robbing a grave are eaten by insects.  A woman is shown examining a skull by lantern-light, while blades magically attack her from behind.  A worker stays past sundown, and is painfully transformed into a snake.

Anyone from the City will tell you that it is ok to wander through the Tombs in the daylight, but when night falls you must be gone or else suffer terribly.

===Kinsul, The Great===
The first tomb you encounter is perhaps the most magnificent.  Carved from the sandstone, lit by the rising sun, is a monument to a pre-imperial empire that once stretched for a thousand miles from the Elven Harmonium to the North Shore.  The imposing hundred-foot high storied facade fronted by massive columns was once decorated with many friezes, which are slowly being washed away by sand, wind, and time.
