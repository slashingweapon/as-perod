title: Gold Wyverns
---

The Emperor Sidir’s personal bodyguard, known as the Wyvernflight, was led by a mysterious figure known only as Qayyan.  Many of the Wyvernflight followed Sidir into the East and, like him, failed to return.  Even after the fey envoy Thassl returned Sidir’s tokens to the Western lands, Qayyan never fully accepted that Sidir was dead.  He and the remnants of Wyvernflight vowed to find Sidir or his remains and return him to the Westlands.  Their search took them up and down the Great River, and beyond it deep into Gon-Perod.  

Twenty years later, Qayyan crossed the Great River and re-entered the As-Perod bearing a box he claimed contained the bones of Sidir.  Qayyan and his box journeyed to Soubous, collecting along the way a small throng of followers: those who honored the memory of the Golden Emperor and wanted to see him buried in the great crypt of kings in the heart of the noble city.  When the procession arrived in Soubous the city steward claimed the remains to be a hoax, and refused them entry into the crypts.  

Angry but undaunted, Qayyan turned his band of odd followers into a civic organization called the Society of the Gold Wyvern, and in time built an imposing home for the organization near the entrance of the Grand Mausoleum.  For centuries the GW’s funded schools and works for the poor and backed populist causes throughout the seven principalities.  The crown jewel of their public works became the bakeries found near every major city, whose most prominent product was crackers, giving the GWs their more colloquial moniker.

After five hundred years of public service the GWs found themselves out of favor throughout the seven principalities on account of their increasingly militant views on social progress and rights for the poor.  Within a decade the organization and it’s main splinter groups has been crushed, the leaders imprisoned or killed, most of the buildings razed.

A few centuries later a halfling woman named Clydesay Durmora claimed she had come into possession not only of the original box containing Sidir’s bones, but also of the secret rites of Wyverns, rites reserved exclusively for the leadership.  Using the Old Rites, as she called them, she resurrected the civic organization as a mystery cult called the Eldereth Tabernacle.  On the night of the new moon, several dozen supplicants would enter the Temple of Mysteries, located on the same site as the original GW headquarters and dissappear, then emerge on the night of the full moon somewhere in the mountains SW of Soubous.

Hundreds of people made the 300 mile underground trek from Soubous into the badlands.  Each day’s journey included obstacles (some of them dangerous), rare underground sights, the telling of ancient stories, and other spiritual encounters.  Most people (dwarves being the notable exception) lost track of time in the deep passage, and their emergence at a formation called “Hanna’s Knees” into fresh air and a starry moonlit sky was welcomed with cheers and celebration: a figurative rebirth.

These excursions were expensive, and no doubt lucrative for Ms. Durmora.  Each supplicant was charged whatever they could bear for their “initiation”, wealthy patrons often paying huge sums.  And there was no shortage of wealthy patrons for such a novel spiritual quest.  Durmora became a powerful presence in Soubous because of her excellent connections among the wealthy, a position she enjoyed even after the authorities put a stop to her initiation rites and disbanded her temple.  

The Wyvernflight has been reborn again in modern times, as a shadowy group seeking a way to resurrect the Golden Emperor and return him to the throne. Aside from a few fliers posted in the city there hasn’t been any real sign of their presence.  They might just be a rumor.
