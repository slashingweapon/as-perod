Assignment 1:

As part of the Map and Scouting Service, <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">[[as-perod/Quintain Ulstradie|Quintain Ulstradie]]</span> tell us to explore the Northern River. We are to chart the river and obstacles, observe the terrain and landscape, look for signs of life and keep an eye out for the Grand Plateau. Thats a colony that was established several months ago, but no one has heard from them in 3 months.

We get on a ship and head north, pass by some big ole rocks that I know are animals, but hey the assigment was to observe not risk life. So we cruise on by.

On the 6th day we find some posts, in a line beaten path on the bank of the river and start walking. Grobnick finds some wrecked ships. We find a gate and sneak past it and see something that looks gnome made. It looks like a town, well most of the buildings are burnt, but still.... One of the surviving house is a residence, I find some harpy feathers. We also find 4 skeletons, 2 adults and 2 kids. Ick. Piffle finds a wooden box in the pantry but wont open it. *cluck* . In the tavern I find a bottle of some nice vino and then Lana and Grobnick get this dumb look in their face and start walking outside. We yell at them but nothing. They walk to this big tree and two freaking huge harpies come flying out. PIffle sets fire to the tree house and then we kill the harpies. We found some nice stuff in the wreckage.


Assignment 2:

We spend a few days at the Grand Plateau, I open the box cause Piffle is too chicken. It is a **<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Suspiciously Smooth Wooden Box</span>** with some scorpion stingers. Neat! I keep those. We report back to Quintain and he doesn't say thanks, instead orders us to the next task. A kid found some carvings on a rock, go investigate. We go to the area, but have no idea where this rock is, we go back and have the little girl show us the carvings. We are lame. Lana thinks the carvings point to a town C-note - it had a guild called Silver Strings. She goes on about some bard who was really cool. I admire the flora as she goes on and on and on. Now C-note was supposed to be on the North Bay and we are on the South Bay, hummm.

We find a few barrows, one has a deer carcass that was eaten by an Owl Bear. Not good, there guys are dangerous and attack without question. We keep traveling down a barrow and there is a huge pit in the main entrance hall. Grobnick throws a lighted stone down the pit, there are 100 zombie gnomes!!! We freak out and Piffle throws a flaming sphere down the pit, they light up like paper. Lana reads the column that says "Here lies enemies of Sedire Golden". He zombied these poor gnomes and they had been in the pit for 1000 years! What a dick!

Piffle finds a silver hand sticking out of the mud. Its a giant statue that talks, hes been waiting 1000 years and is kinda broken, but he obeys. He also has this voice who calls himself Marty, I have no idea what he is talking about. He helps us fight the baby owl bears (we kill 1) and then the papa owl bear attacks, we run but eventually kill it. We argue about what to do with the baby owl bears. Iskin the owl bear and make jerky. AT88 carried my new owl bear beak backpack.

I found a herbalist room and took all the mushrooms, will check them out when we are owl bear free.

Assignment 3 Owl Bears make good pets.

We report back to <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">[[as-perod/Quintain Ulstradie|Quintain Ulstradie]]. He is amazed that we found C-note on the South Bay. Then he grumbles a bit and tells us to go back and get the owl bears that we shoved into the jail. Back to C-note, grab the owl bears and back to town. On the way the Warblade squeeks "hey" and we see a Satyr running away! Half man and half goat! AT88 grabs it and threatens to kill him a bunch of times, that robot needs to learn some manners. We all calm down a bit and make nice. We talk for a little bit, he tells us about the the hominds around here, his boss is the Lady of the Silver Vale, giants live to the south and they are big and mean, the owl bear was named Old Grumpy and there is a troll.</span>

Satyr name is Fenast, he likes music and can sing and dance. I taught him a few of our dice games. He goes on his merry way.
