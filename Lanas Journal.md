The boss wants us to go investigate some painting on a rock near some burrows. He says to call in reinforcements if we need to.

Here's what I know about the signpost:

* This is a sign post for the town. Usually it would be the town name, and the signs of the major guilds. This sign is missing the town name.
* From the guild markings the most prominent guild here was the Silverstrings, a bard’s guild. The other prominent guilds were an instrument maker’s guild, and an herbalist guild.
* The last Silverstrings master was Alrin Anon, whose “Peoples’ Lament” is recorded in The Book.
* This town was probably Seanote, which was the home of the famous Silverstrings guild. But Seanote was supposedly located on the North side of the Bay, not the south.

We find a pit, filled with undead. They are the city dwellers, undead 1000 years. Sign next to the pit - This is what happens to the enemies of Sedir.

What an ass.

And an adamantine statue or a gnome, but as big as a human. In bad repair - dented, warped or broken. 8088 is written on it's front. He's broken, but luckily I find a workshop that has all the parts and tools he'll need to repair himself. At one point, he starts talking with another voice - he says he's Marty. Some gnome spirit in the machine.

I also find the frets, tuning pegs, tailpiece and other metal parts and inlay from a very stylish mandolin... After close inspection, I'm sure it was Alrin Anon's. I'll seek out a talented instrument maker to restore this to its former glory - or better!. I'll ask 8088/Marty for information about Alrin's mandolin, and get the maker to build it like that, with some modifications for me.

Oh, we killed a big daddy owlbear. We capture the 3 remaining baby owlbears. We'll have them trained to protect our camp.

Finast, a satyr, tries to pick Ronjoon's pocket. We nab him. I attempt to interrogate him. Things aren't so great, because AT88 is holding him up and playing bad cop. My good cop isn't very good. We eventually make things right.

I show the 3 uncut emeralds to Marty - they come from clay beds north of here. Worth about 150 gp total.

When I was performing at the tavern, I notice a the same rich man at many of my shows. But he apparently doesn't know talent, because he gets up and leaves shortly after I start my act. I made my next performance extra saucy, and he still got up an left. No one in the tavern knows who he is. He only started coming after I started performing there.

Really, it's quite insulting. I will find out who this man thinks he is, and then I'll let him know who he REALLY is.

The boss wants us to find out about the human fort nearby. Apparently they are being very unfriendly.
