title: Samit
---

Samit (685-770 BCE by the imperial calendar) was the first real king of Aspera, a consumate warrior and statesman who built an empire ranging from the icy mountains in the south to the lake city of [Nychanter](Nychanter.html).  He turned a collection of waring petty kings into a cohesive nation that stood for eight centuries before [Mosyph](Mosyph.html)'s empire came along and subjugated it.

# The Relics of Samit

Samit claimed his rule was by divine right, as evidenced by possession of three holy relics.  These were given to him by the priests of the temple at [Oxhed](Oxhed.html), as a symbol of his fitness to rule and the favor of the gods.  Most of the history of the First King surround these mystical artifacts, and the deeds he performed with them.

The most famous of these was the sword Enercrist, with which he subdued his enemies. The sword could cut through even the thickest of armor, drive away fear, and destroy undead. The second relic was the throne from whence King Samit dispensed justice. No lie, deceit, or disguise could endure its presence. The last relic was the royal scepter, which had the power to break any magic.

When Samit died his three sons split the relics between them.  Over the the course of several centuries their families guarded the items jelously until wars and subterfuges caused all the relics to be lost.  

## Enercrist

The most famous relic was the sword Enercrist, which was willed to the King's oldest son Jamyt.  As the best recognized and most feared of all the relics, it is perhaps understandable that it went to the son who would be king.  King Jamyt also had a very combative personality, much like his father before him, so the sword suited his temperment.

Enercrist was wielded by King Levonitas the Younger when he ejected the Empire from Aspera c.330 CE.  That battle ended when King Levonitas and the emperor's War Marshal met each other on the field of battle in personal combat.  Levonitas carried the day, but the sword was broken during the fight.  

The shards of Enercrist were entombed with it's last master, deep under [Oxhed](Oxhed.html).  Rumors persist that the pieces of Enercrist are kept in the royal armory, or that the sword was never broken at all.  But these are entirely unsubstantiated.

## The High Seat

Samit's throne was willed to his youngest son Ulstrom.  Still a very young man then, Prince Ulstrom had what his father called "good horse sense".  Ulstrom was known for his insight and his keen sense of justice, eventually becoming High Justicar of the realm.  He ran an itinerant high court, constantly touring the kingdom to hear cases instead of remaining in [Oxhed](Oxhed.html).  Samit's throne went with Ulstrom as he traveled his circuit, and in time became known as the High Seat.

All of this left Ulstrom's brother the King without a throne to sit on.  King Jamyt built a grander one out of rare woods and precious metals, more fit for a king in its appearance.  Later kings tried to take possession of the High Seat, which was ultimately spirited away by Ulstrom's descendants.  It resurfaced again briefly after Asperian independence from the empire, but disappeared again in the fifth century.

The seat resurfaced again in 1146 when a party of adventurers discovered it under Mt. Stamhead.  It had been hidden there by the descendants of Dukes Harrell of [Corak](Corak.html) and Hemmet of Stamfield, to keep it safe from the  [Arcane Academy](Arcane Academy.html).  The reappearance of the High Seat incited a schism between Aspera which considered it a religious and historic relic of the highest order, and the Academy which declared it a dangerous artifact that could unbalance the material world.  In the Autumn of 1146, King Oldeaus expelled the Academy from Aspera.

The seat was spirited away to [Oxhed](Oxhed.html), where it was put to use in the service of the High Justicar.

### Description

The High Seat looks less like a throne than it does a folding wooden chair used by military commanders in the field.  It folds up into a lightweight package that is easily carried by one man.  Unfolded, it is made of rare helion wood, which is silver-gray in color.  When the King occupies the seat a carved moon is above his head, helion trees grow on his left and right their branches reaching out to the moon.  Beneath the trees are the sons of Te, Heironeous and Hextor, their weapons ready to guard the king.  Under his left hand is law, and under his right is chivalry.

Sitting on the High Seat grants one wisdom and insight into others.  Standing before the High Seat, most people feel compelled to speak only truth.

## Orb of Nychanter

Samit's middle son Kagan received the scepter.  It was a rod of cold iron capped with a platinum design on the bottom and at the top a massive diamond shaped into a many-faceted orb.  Although seldom seen, the Orb was reportedly in the possession of Kagan's family in the palace of Nychanter where it was seldom displayed (perhaps because of its obvious intrinsic value).

The Orb was definitely used at least twice after Samit's death.  Once it was used to defeat the enchantress Kotmar when she tried to lay a spell on the entire keep.  It was used again during the war against [Mosyph](Mosyph.html).  It gave the emperor so much trouble that he confiscated it, but it was returned to Kagan's descendants as part of the terms of Asperian surrender.

The Orb reportedly remained in the care of Kagan's descendants until 989, when floods washed away the palace along with most of the city.  But in fact there are no documented sightings of the orb after 1 BCE.
