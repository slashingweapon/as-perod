title: Reeland
---

Reeland is a large city situated just outside the [Yeron](Yeron.html) flood plain, at the intersection of the river highway and the road from [Rotherford](Rotherford.html).  This positions Reeland as the near-perfect place to accept raw goods from all over the kingdom.  The city also boasts an active commodities market, a sizeable Academy campus, and many of the best craftsmen in the kingdom.

All told, there are about 120,000 people who live either in Reeland and in the surrounding townships.  There is a very large, very active garrison in Reeland that includes about 1800 riders and over 2000 footmen.  These forces rotate out into the field for two weeks at a time, guarding roads and townships in the area.  

= Economy =

Wood comes from the Rotherford road, metals come from the Silver Hills, foodstuffs, linen and hemp fiber from all along the rier basin.  Much of the raw goods produced in Aspera are bought and sold in Reeland, either directly or by contract.  The abundance of raw goods also makes Reeland an attractive spot for crafting finished goods, which is why there are more and better crafters here than anywhere else in the kingdom.  Finished goods made for export are shipped to [Maedyn](Maedyn.html) for taxation before heading to [Ild-Eldir](Ild-Eldir.html) or [Soubous](Soubous.html).  

The royal coinage is also here.  Gold and silver smelted in the southern mines is stamped by royal inspectors there and floated downstream to Reeland.  The crown takes it's share in taxes, coins it, then either lends or spends it.  

The money-lenders (they are never called bankers, which would be too respectable a name) come in two flavors.  One will aggregate relatively small sums and guarantee a modest return (2-3%).  Lenders will make smallish loans for up to five years at 10-15% per annum.  Large sums are loaned by special arrangements in which the lenders are really brokers: they put the users and sources together for a share of the interest.  

Lenders are frowned upon socially, but they are indespensible.  They are also an excellent source of revenue for the crown, which oversees the business quite carefully.  A great number of lenders are gnomes, who as outsiders are largely immune to the stigma attached to their occupation.

= Leadership =

Lord Jaq Sisox, Count of Reeland, is a rider and nobleman descended from a long line of riders and nobles.  He has been involved in every major armed conflict in Aspera, and quite a few minor ones, for the last thirty years.  He loves life in the field and personally leads his men on patrols whenever he can find a good excuse -- which isn't nearly often enough for his tastes.

The Count is gracious to old comrades-at-arms or anyone he perceieves as being courageous or who has recently performed an act of valor.  He makes time for such people, even if it is only an hour for lunch.  He has a reputation for leadership and an uncanny ability to sniff out other peoples' true motives.
