[[#Vultures]]
**3 Summer 1141, in the Badlands** 

Some people spy vultures in the distance, but can't make out what they are circling. Villheim sends the party forward to investigate and report back.

The party finds dozens of vultures fighting over the remains of several wagons and six corpses of men-at-arms. The damage is about 3 days old. Nearly all the goods are missing, but Nolan finds the manifest box. Basil finds tracks of hobgoblins and bugbears, and another set of tracks that have been deliberately covered up. He says he can smell some kind of dragon.

Minzerec rides back to tell Villheim the news and give him the box. Villheim force marches the whole caravan to get to the Arms of Vohanis (the outer marker of territory controlled by the city) by nightfall, stopping only long enough to properly bury the dead.

That night Villheim says, "Not everyone in the caravan is accounted for. The caravan master and three of his men are still missing, as are all his passengers. There is a family of five, named Pourcel. See the mark next to their name in the log? That means Gurnac knew the name was false. There are two men of Soubous named Alinar and Haifor, and their two servants. I cannot demand you do it, but my conscience demands that I ask. Will you try to find them and rescue them, or at least recover their bodies for burial? The guild will pay you well for any recovered passengers, and I hate to leave their fate to goblins now that my own caravan is safe."

Villheim will wait for at least another day before continuing on, to make it easier for the party to catch back up with the caravan.

**4 Summer 1141** [[#Raiders]]

Before dawn, the party leaves the caravan behind and rides back to where the ambush took place. Basil and the sisters' horses together make a good tracking team (someone had gotten smart and taught the chargers to track by scent), and track the group for about fourty miles. Toward the end of the day the party is tracking the raiders along a dry riverbed when the Aidan's horse acts like it can smell or hear something ahead.

Nolan creeps forward, and finds a group of eight hobgoblins and two bugbears, seven prisoners, and four heavily-laden horses. A plan is formed. The sisters act lost to lure the raiders into a bottleneck of the riverbed, while Erky and Minzerec fire down from above. Basil and Nolan try to free the prisoners. The plan works rather too nicely: the hobgoblins are easy prey for warriors on chargers, and without friends the bugbears aren't feeling so tough. Earthen grasp works. Aidan performs a nice trample attack, and Basil takes down the grappled bugbear with some cool martial maneuver nobody has seen before. The party leaves the critically wounded to the desert.

The prisoners are freed, but they are in terrible shape. One is dead, they are all exhausted and injured, and the women have been sexually assaulted. Some in the party think they should head back immediately, while others point out that the prisoners are in no shape to be moved.

In the distance, farther down the dry riverbed, the party can see the tops of buildings sticking up from the ground. They decide not to explore.

XP: 1600
Treasure: 600sp

**4 Summer 1141, (con't)** [[#Survivors]]

The prisoners present in the hobgoblin/bugbear camp are these:

* Gurnac, the caravan leader. What's left of him is roasting over the fire.
* Lesex, a man-at-arms for Gurnac
* Jodana "Pourcel". Lost her husband (Iofor) and son (Iofir) during the forced march.
* Edaen, Jodana's teenage daughter
* Janis, Jadana's toddler daughter
* Alinar, a gentleman of Soubous. He died just hours ago, of wounds and exhaustion. His body is still chained to the other prisoners.
* Leo, Alinar's servant boy.
* Haifor, a gentleman of Soubous and friend to Alinar.
* Giles, Haifor's servant boy.

The party does what healing it can, cuts the load off of the four caravan horses, and prepares to leave immediately. Nolan gives the trade goods a once-over, but doesn't find anything of obvious value. Haifor recovers his enchanted morningstar from one of the hobbs.

Jodana has a request, that the party keep an eye out for the body of her husband. He had something that was very valuable, and which needs to be recovered. It was something he picked up in [[Vohanis]], and she is worried that something bad will happen to her family if the thing isn't found and returned to it's rightful owner. "And I have so little family left to me now." Looking through the pile of dumped trade goods, she finds the box it was in, a 3'x5"x5" wooden affair with a thorned flower inlaid on the top. During the attack, her husband took the item out of the box and hid it on his person. She doesn't know what it was.

By doubling up smaller people on some of the horses, everyone has a mount. The party sets out. On the way, Haifor describes how the caravan was attacked at night by a dragon on the wing. They never saw him very well, but he carried an aura of fear and breathed lightning. Focused on the dragon, terrified and fleeing, they were easy prey for the hobgoblin raiders.

The party sets out, planning to cover the whole 40 mile return trip without resting.

[[#Raiders2]]
**5 Summer 1141** 

In the wee hours of the morning the party is attacked by a 20' long centipede-like monster being ridden by a bugbear, and four hobgoblin archers. The fighting is fierce, and Lesex and Haifor pitch in. Lesex is nearly killed. Minzerec hides behind his horse, which runs away when it gets shot. Aidan attacks the centipede-thing head-on, and discovers that anything wounding the creature gets acid all over it. Minzerec does some nice spellwork. The centipede bites, grabs, and swallows Aidan. Things look grim, but she gets out. She is short one-half a battleaxe and a dagger.

Aidan is angry, and wants to be a barbarian. She settles instead for chopping the bugbear's leg off at the knee so he falls off his mount, barely conscious (it probably helped that he was barely mobile by that point). Nolan does some damage to the centipede, and gets his nice weapon damaged. The enemy runs, and the party rides after the centipede-thing, using ranged attacks from horseback to hound it until it dies. The surviving hobgoblins (3) get away.

The bugbear's last words: "Neveneth the Night Terror will avenge me."

Treasure:
* Offset composite longbow. +1 to hit (+1 magic), +3 weapon damage (+1 magic, +2 strength), +1d6 acid damage. Requires a strength of 14 to use effectively. Can be used mounted. 8600gp.

During the day, the party finds the remains of Iofor and Iofir. Underneath his clothing Iofor was hiding a metal rod, about 3' long, with the figure of a snake's head at one end. It is magical. The party loads up the dead bodies and continues on to the Arms of Vohanis. They join up with their own caravan, and everyone gets to rest.

**7-10 Summer 1141**

The party travels to Vohanis without incident. The road is well-patrolled, the fees are paid, and nobody messes with the caravan.

On the 8th, the new moon passes without incident. No undead attacks. No dreams or visions of portent. Nothing.

[[#Vohanis]]
**11 Summer 1141, [[Vohanis]]**

It has taken 20 days to reach Vohanis from [[Maedyn]].

The caravan sets up camp outside Vohanis, after paying the appropriate fees of course. The players begin setting up their stage for a full-on production, expecting a good crowd that night. Nolan and Aidan hire a Hospitaler guide to take them through the city safely, since that's where all the good markets are. The city occupies a winding network of wind-carved canyons, and most of the nicer buildings are carved into the canyon rock face.

The guide explains that, in Vohanis, "everyone belongs to someone". Going inside the city without the protection of one of the guilds makes you open game for anyone. Nolan and Aidan learn that the thorned flower they saw earlier is the symbol of the poisoners' guild. The number of thorns indicate the rank of poisoner.

Nolan finds a weaponsmith to repair his sword.

xp: 800
treasure: 800gp (Payment by Villheim's guild for the return of passengers.)

[[#Vohanis2]]
**12-13 Summer 1141, [[Vohanis]] (con't)**

There is a lot of discussion about what, if anything to do about the mysterious object, now identified as a //Rod of the Viper//. It is decided that the rod is too powerful and too evil an object to be left lying around, or to give to people of suspect character. Instead, the party decides to hang on to it and tell nobody except Jodana. If she is confronted by anyone wanting to know where the rod is, she should tell them all she knows. She agrees. Minzerec intends to give the rod to the Academy, and let them decide what to do with it.

The party only stays in Vohanis long enough for Nolan's sword to be repaired and for Aidan to buy a new weapon. On the morning of the 14th they leave.

[[#Ogres]]
**17 Summer 1141, wilderness**

For the first two nights, the journey is quick and peaceful. With a little help from Minzerec and no caravan to slow them down, the party covers nearly sixty miles a day. They leave behind them the territory of Vohanis as quickly as possible, and traverse the wilderness. Erkey creates water for the group, and they avoid the guarded wells.

On the third watch of the third night the party is attacked by ogres, one of them a berzerker. The battle is pitched, a lot of healing is required. //Mirror Image// saves Minzerec's life twice. Nolan gets in a good backstab with help from Minzerec. Aidan and Nadia together overcome the berzerker ogre. Some kind of green spell-casting ogre shows up and nearly kills the party with a freezing spell. Yet somehow the good guys prevail.

While Aidan is trampling down the last ogre and the party is just starting to heal, [[Neveneth]] makes his appearance. Nadia's horse flees, with her still on it. Nolan runs and hides. Minzerec is shaken. Neveneth starts picking off the party with lightning and fly-by attacks, but Erkey annoys him by healing people. Aidan returns and gets off some good shots with her bow, scoring a very deep wound with Minzerec's help, but she's the only person to do significant damage. The dragon's second lightning bolt puts Erkey down and wounds Aidan.

Neveneth charges Aidan, head-butts her, and she end up unconscious in her saddle. Then he digs Nolan out from under his bush and beats him senseless. Basil returns and tries to face down the dragon alone while Father Ambrose plays dead. Neveneth seems to have a good time pummeling them both into unconsciousness.

Fade to black...

XP: 700 @ 4th level (only for those who weren't gray when the party fought the ogres)

[[#Elves]]
**17 Summer 1141, in an elven camp**

In return for his experientially devoid (and perhaps interrupted) thrashing last-minute by Neveneth, Father Ambrose is the first to awake, but one by one the rest of the party comes to, slowly and painfully, in the shelter of a large white tent. Lying among cushions and pillows on a thick rug, surrounded by their belongings, the party hears voices speaking elvish from behind the tent. Basil, recognizing it as regular camp talk, goes out to find and greet someone in charge. Blessings are exchanged, and Marasef enters the guests' tent to see how they are doing. He is astonished at the quick recovery of the group.

Marasef explains that his tribe (the Ashanar) was camped several miles from where the party fought the dragon, and couldn't help but hear/see the commotion. They sent scouts, who discovered the party. The tribe gathered up the unconscious people, recovered their all the belongings, looted the ogres, and brought the group to the safety of the camp. There was no sign of the magic ogre. Marasef explains that she is known to his tribe, and she's been a source of trouble for a few years.

The party is given water and food. Later that evening at dinner, the tribe leader is introduced (Qatir), along with a lot of others. The camp makeup is 15 combatants, five other adults, and four children. Qatir questions the party over dinner about what happened, and is particularly interested in the capabilities of the dragon. He has heard of Neveneth, but never of his being so far north. There is a lot of speculation as to why the dragon didn't take more of the party's stuff. Qatir and Marasef seem to think the party hurt the dragon badly enough that it didn't want to tangle with the elven scouting party, so he just took the best things he had found so far and left. (Most everyone seems to think this explanation is, mostly, reasonable.)

Qatir's people are themselves traveling north, to a kobold trading post called [[Gdazn Rox]]. They go to trade food, metal tools, and silver [[krone]]s for raw uncut gems. "It may sound strange that we trade with kobolds, but we have an understanding with them." explains Qatir, "We aren't what we once were in the days before the sundering, but nonetheless nobody wants a war against the elves."

Minzerec tells the party in private that the box with the //rod of the viper// is missing, as is Aidan's bow. Neveneth apparently took them, but didn't take anything else. The ogres also had loot, which the Ashanars recovered. Father Ambrose is intrigued by a masterwork great club liberated from the ogres, and prays to Saint Cuthbert for the strength to wield it properly that he may dispense Cuthbert's wisdom to the unwise.

Treasure:
* masterwork greatclub (305gp, 8 lbs, 1d10)
* masterwork bastard sword, large (670gp, 12 lbs, dmg 2d8 19-20/x2)
* 400gp
* small pouch containing small gems worth 1000gp

**18 Summer 1141**

In the interest of mutual security, the party is invited to travel with the Ashanars. The tribe is willing to wait until the party is better rested, but the party insists it is ready to go immediately.

Minzerec uses magic to hasten the days' travels.

[[#Ogres2]]
**19 Summer 1141, the north desert**

On the first watch an alarm is raised, someone shouting something about ogres, and the camp is roused. As most of the party grabs their weapons and rush out of the tent with whatever they have on, Father Ambrose, in keeping with his training from the school of protection, elects to don his armor. Minzerec provides //Dolorous Blow// for Aidan and her axe.

Large rocks fly into the camp from the northwest side of the camp, taking down some elves. Nadia and Aidan soon find the source of the rocks: two [[http://www.savagebeatdown.com/srd/monstersA.html#athach|athach]] (huge three-armed ogre-like aberrations), and Qatir and Marasef engage them, quickly joined by the sisters. Elven archers fire into the faces of the monsters, but most of the arrows can't penetrate their thick hide. Aidan, Nadia, and Marasef carve their way into the monsters, while Minzerec takes up a position twenty feet behind them. Qatir does some pole-arm tripping maneuver that topples one of them, and Nolan is slipping around for a flanking attack. Ambrose is putting on his armor. The battle is just looking to be in hand when...

The ogre mage who escaped the party before appears and blasts the melee fighters with cold. Qatir (the family patriarch) goes down. At the same time, a bigger-than-usual ogre wearing spiked plate mail and using a bastard sword charges Aidan and deals her a resounding blow. Basil goes invisible and shoots fire at the mage. Erkey shoots and hits her, too. Minzerec hits the spiky ogre with a purple ray that makes him unable to do much. The ogre mage tries to put Erkey to sleep, but fails. The elven archers are still trying to hurt things, but aren't being very effective. Ambrose is putting on his armor.

The two athach are killed, but the mage has gone invisible again. Somehow, Qatir is standing. The entire party converges on the spiked-mail ogre which is slowly... trying... to... get... away. Erkey heals, and Ambrose continues to don his armor. The ogre goes gasseous (with help from the mage, who is flying and invisible) and tries to fly up, but that only makes things worse for him when the magic that made him that way evaporates. Suddenly solid again, he plummets to the earth, and dies. The party then runs down the mage, who is invisible. Minzerec tracks her with //Detect Magic//, a few people are lucky enough to stick an arrow in her, and in spite of many misses she takes some damage. Finally done donning his armor, Ambrose runs out of the tent to find out where the battle is.

The ogre mage tries to fly away but everyone chases her. Father Ambrose, seeing Nolan sprinting after her, taps him with //Bull Strength//, but Basil gets to her first and performs one last fire-sword maneuver which knocks her unconscious long enough to float down where everyone can converge on her. They poke her with many weapons, and Marasef performs a coup-de-grace.

Two of the elf sentries, Bariat and Ainnen, are dead. They were Qatir's children, twins he had late in life when he thought all happiness was behind him. He is beyond consolation. Marasef takes charge of the camp, ordering the enemy bodies to be stripped and burned. No talk yet on how to divide the spoils.

XP: 800 @ fifth level

Treasure:
> 970gp
> a platinum [[krone]] (1000gp)
> star rose quartz (60gp)
> +1 Blinding heavy steel shield, human sized (4170gp)
> +1 cloak of resistance (1000gp)
> +1 full plate mail, large sized (4400gp)
> +2 amulet of health (4000gp)
> potion of cat's grace (300gp)
(Yes, I'm assuming the necessary magic gets done.)

[[#After]]
**20 Summer 1141, the north desert**

Qatir has secluded himself, so Marasef takes over the camp responsibilities. Most of his people will turn south and return to their canyon home, with the bodies of his half-brother and half-sister, Bariat and Ainnen. Qatir wants to try and bury them at home, even though the bodies might start to decay on the way. Ambrose and Erkey volunteer to cast //Gentle Repose// to keep the bodies whole for the journey.

From the ogre loot, Marasef takes only the shield and the gem. The shield belonged to an Ashanar warrior, and her family will be glad to have it back. The gem he will keep to memorialize the occasion. He wants nothing else, because the victory is a bitter one for his family.

Although most of the camp is heading south, Marasef's wife Khatna along with four guards are continuing north. Much of the family's trade depends on the jewelry she and her apprentices make, so her business in [[Gdazn Rox]] can not be delayed.

The party departs for Gdazn that morning, accompanied by Khatna and her guard. Everyone is traveling pretty light, and with Minzerec's //Lively Step// they expect only a half-day's journey.

[[#Rox]]
**20 Summer 1141, [[Gdazn Rox]]**

Near the top of the descent is [[Gdazn Rox]], often called a kobold settlement but also the only place to trade within at least a hundred miles in any direction. The party binds or surrenders all their weapons, except small daggers. Within the palisade the settlement is composed of a bazar, a shanty town, and cave dwellings carved into the hillside. Aside from kobolds there is a fair number of ogres, a few trolls, and a smattering of goblinoids.

The party manages to sell the armor for 20,000 silver pieces, or 200 silver krones (400 lbs of silver bullion). They elect to ask Khatna to trade 2500gp of silver and other coins for raw gemstones. While waiting for all of this to take place, some members of the party visit the "Cave of Wonders", a tourist trap featuring a natural cavern with some interesting geological features, sparkly walls, a statue of a kobold hero, various kobold propaganda murals, and a partially excavated skeleton of what must of been an ancient wyrm. The plaque says "This is Jaugua the Magnificent, ruler of these parts long ago. He devoured all who stood before him." There is a gift shop selling mostly copper medallions stamped with Jagua's name and supposed likeness, and some rocks that glow in the dark.

The party easily finds the only establishments catering to humanoids: a store run by the dwarf Corinth Deepforge, a not-very-good inn (Minzerec declares the beer undrinkable), and a book seller / cartographer Flanitolius "Nibbs" Phelitidean.

The cartographer is especially helpful. Not only is he able to provide detailed maps of the swamp roads and cities, but also maps of the Eastern Isles (as they are most commonly called). When the party shows him [[Alamion|Alamion's Journal]] he suggests a trade: he'll make the maps of the islands for free if the party lets him copy out the journal and its images. They agree.

The next morning, Khatna takes her leave of the party, her business in the trading post completed. To Nolan, Aiden, and Nadia she gives special wraps for their weapons which are made of a strikingly exotic leather. (+5 on attack rolls to resist disarm attempts). To Minzerec she gives a small box of powdered inks and gemstones for scribing scrolls. To Erkey and Ambrose she gives pins in the shape of desert flowers, which is a sign of her tribe, and names them friends of her people. To Basil she gives only her thanks, because he needs nothing else.

The party wiles away the days staying out of trouble until their maps are completed. Nibbs is very excited by one of the illustrations in the journal, which he believes pinpoint the location of the island which the party seeks. He accurately positions the hoped-for island on the party's map of the [[Western Isles]] (aka "Jeweled Isles").

[[#Swampy]]
**24 Summer 1141, Swampland**

The party leaves Gdazn Rox and takes what they believe is the safest road north to Corisat. The travel is slower because of thick vegetation, a road long in disrepair, and often unsteady ground. But they don't face any serious dangers.

[[#Corisat]]
**28 Summer 1141, [[Corisat]]**

As the road approaches the sea, the swamp gradually becomes tidal marsh. The road turns west and begins to climb a group of hills that are gathered around a small natural bay. The grassy hills are dotted with small herds of grazing animals, homesteads that feature comfortable-looking stone houses, and the occasional burnt-out cottage. The hills tumble down toward the sea and bay itself finally comes into view. Corisat is several dozen two- and three-story buildings pressed up against the docks. There is no defensive wall around the town, but a dozen fortified catapults and ballista are pointed out towards the bay. The entrance to the bay is very narrow, and is flanked by more catapult positions.

The party finds itself at the Bluebutter inn, where they take the entire top floor as lodging for 1gp a day, meals and errand-girl included. Tiran, the girl, is highly inquisitious and gets smacked by Nolan. She doesn't seem to mind. "I get much worse from the sailors." Next door is the Merrydell drinking hall, whose beer is drinkable even by Minzerec's standards. After settling in, the sisters go in search of Ackfred, GBB to present their letter of introduction.

Ackfred turns out to be the identical triplets George, Barley, and Brian and they live rather comfortably in part of a large warehouse. They seem excited at the prospect of finally repaying their debt to Ferrule Lighthammer, who did them a good turn some ten years previously. Alas, they have no ships available at present. All are out to sea, and the party will have to wait until a little later in the season, when the summer winds blow the northeastern fleets to Corisat.

The brothers question Aidan and Nadia (not //too// closely) about where they are going, how much cargo they expect to take and return with, and the number of people they expect to travel with. The Ackfreds think it will be a couple of weeks before a suitable transport is available.

Minzerec meets with the Wiz. Garret, who does not (officially) represent the Academy. He just lives and works here.

XP: 300 @ 5th level

[[#Tentacles]]
**32 Summer 1141, [[Corisat]]**

At the invitation of Ackfred (GBB), the party plays escort for a short trade mission. The Ackfreds trade finished metal goods and a few other items to some ogres, in exchange for a lot of raw iron. The exchange happens just within the salt marsh, and seems to go pretty well.

On the way back, the party is ambushed by something with numerous tentacles and prodigious magical abilities. Some of the tentacles use weapons, while others grapple. The pikemen and crossbows from the town are practically useless, and the monster grapples anything that comes close. Completely forgetting his tumbling skills, Basil jumps neatly into an embrace with the monster and is almost killed. Eventually they kill the thing.

Some of the weapons that the monster was using were valuable. Still, Aidan saws the thing in half with her axe because she is convinced it must have something more valuable hidden somewhere deep inside its body. In reward of her efforts, she finds a large lump of silver coins, wrapped in black bad-smelling viscous goo deep in the stinking guts of the strange beast.

Baths all around when the party gets to town, and when the sisters get to the inn the bard is singing about the pikemen's heroic victory against the tentacle monster. Aidan clues the bard in on the truth of the matter, which inspires him to write [[Ass Pennies]]. No one complains that the bard awards all the credit for the creature's demise to Aidan, least of all Father Ambrose.

The party passes several lazy days in town, waiting for their ship to come in (literally).

XP: 760 @ 4th lvl
Treasure:
> 2000sp
> Masterwork, ceremonial dagger 300gp.
> longsword +1

[[#Fleet]]
**40 Summer 1141, [[Corisat]]**

An alarm rings, and the town goes into a frenzy of activity. The first fleet of the season has been spotted. A lot of buildings thought to be empty or warehouses are opened up as drinking halls or houses of ill repute. Lots of women come down from the surrounding farms dressed in their best come-hithers. The best furniture and drink is put away, to be replaced by low-cost cruft. The party is ejected from their rooms and invited to join Tiran in the countryside, where they will be out of the way during the seven-week long Bacchanal.

On the 43rd, the party receives word from the Ackfreds that their ship has arrived, and they will have an interview with Captain Valar on the morrow.

[[#Valar]]
**44 Summer 1141, a cottage near [[Corisat]]**

Captain Valar arrives mid-morning to introduce himself.  He is handsome, courteous, and seems quite confident.  He is young for a captain, but has spent most of his life at sea.  With his shoulder-length dark hair, olive skin, and sea-green eyes, he is the very picture of an Eboan sailor.  If he was just a little more flamboyant, he could be called dashing.

Valar questions the party closely about their task, where they are headed, cargo, deadlines, and so on.  His ship, the Pharon, will be ready in three days.  He has to re-stock and change out some of his crew.  On the day of departure, he will come for the party near dawn.

[[#Pharon]]
**47 Summer 1141, the Pharon**

True to his word, Valar arrive at dawn to escort the party to the ship.  Within minutes their belongings are stowed and everyone is in their place.  By the time the sun is up, the ship is out to sea.

A few people get seasick, but it passes after five or six days.  The trip is uneventful, but the company is decent.  Valar puts everyone to work during the day, or else keeps them out of the way.  At night there is gambling in the hold, and songs  or swordplay on the deck.  The only downside is the food, which isn't terribly good.

[[#Blackwater]]
**58 Summer 1141, [[Blackwater]]**

The Pharon puts into port at the city of Blackwater, one of the greatest cities in all As-Perod.  The harbor is wide and deep, overlooked by steep hills that have been terraced and planted with olive orchards.  At the top of the hills stands the palaces and greathouses of the city, their white stone buildings gleaming in the sun.

Much of the city is invisible from the docks, but over 60 thousand people live here.  The Academy has a very large campus, and no less than a dozen Magi live and work in Blackwater.  Minzerec spends much of the next few days at the campus, doing who-knows-what.

Basil prowls the city looking for fellow students of the Nine Ways, and finds several establishments dedicated to martial arts.

Cpt Valar is very busy with his supercargo, trading goods and loading/unloading goods.  But he does manage to take an afternoon off to show Aidan a few of the sights.

Nolan runs into the wizard Dequine, who is deputy to the Academy Ambasador in Blackwater.  He knows all the magi who live in or pass through Blackwater.  He went to school with Issyren, but hasn't seen her in ten years.  He seems certain she hasn't been through Blackwater since then.

Dequine doesn't know anything about the Western Isles, but directs Nolan to the Magi Kosmano and even manages to scrawl off a letter of introduction before nodding off into boozy sleep.  Nolan and Minzerec procure a few small pearls to offer her, and she proves to be slightly helpful.

Kosmano is a native of the Eastern Isles, and knows much of the lore from there.  She tells the party that the Far Islands are known to her, but her people seldom go there.  They are too far away for the small fishing vessles her people use and, although the pearls are superior, the waters can be exceedingly dangerous for divers.  

Most troublesome on the surface are huge birds, as large as houses, which are said to swoop down and pluck sailors right off the decks of the ships.  When asked how the birds can be dealt with, she shrugs and says "You could try tying yourself down.  There's a story about a man who did that."

The magi is very skeptical about the idea of an Oracle.  "If such a thing existed, I think we would know about it.  Such power would be coveted, and people would fight wars to get it.  If you are looking for this oracle, then I think you will be disappointed."

[[#Stavengard]]
**62 Summer 1141, [[Blackwater]]**

The Pharon ships out from Blackwater, and after two days at sea anchors outside the [[Stavengard]] alongside a dozen other ships.  The next morning as the tide changes sails are raised, oars are turned, and the ships all shoot through the 30-mile-long strait at an alarming pace.  At the end of the strait, hewn from the mountain face of [[EShyris|E'Shyris]], is the 1000' tall lighthouse of Stavengard.  (ooh. aah.)

Within a couple of days of leaving the strait the Pharon enters the Western Isles.  Valar says he is heading for a village that he knows, where he's on good terms with the local people.  He plans to trade metal tools and cloth for rare skins and feathers, herbs, and lumber made from exotic woods.

The journey is quiet, with only one small incident: a ship tries to intercept the Pharon.  Cpt. Valar lets the Pharon run at its best speed, and in a few hours leaves the other ship over the horizon.

[[#Slavers]]
**72 Summer 1141, the island of [[Permoso|Per'moso]]**

As the Pharon approaches its destination, smoke can be seen rising from the vicinity of the village.  The ship slides quietly into the lagoon, and sees a very large trireme already anchored there.  The village is on fire, and slavers are rounding up everyone they haven't killed into launches.

The party insists on attacking the slavers, and at first Cpt Valar appears concerned for the safety of his passengers.  Once he's convinced the party knows what its about, he eagerly turns his ship towards the slavers.  Suddenly, there's a lot of weapons on deck.

The trireme only has a dozen men on the main deck, and they are poor shots.  Several volleys later, and men on both ships are hurt.  When the Pharon closes with the slaver, things get interesting.  Basil leaps the gap between the ships and cuts down one of the sailors.  Valar's men put out a plank, which Aidan and Nadia use to board the slaver and hew their way through more sailors.  Non-melee folks perch on the foredeck and aftdeck to fire across at the other ship.  The ship is won quickly, and only one enemy slaver is in any condition to actually surrender.

None of this goes unnoticed by the fourty or so slavers ashore.  They drop what they are doing and pile into their four launches, and row like mad for the trireme.  Valar orders his men back to his own ship, and places himself on the aftdeck to watch the show.  Lots of arrows and bolts are exchanged, and when the slavers get close enough the party throws flaming bottles of alcohol and (in Minzerec's case) alchemists fire down into the boats.  The alchemists fire is especially effective.  With all four launches aflame, men not rowing, and many jumping into the water to extinguish themselves (and in a few cases drown in the bargain), the slavers surrender.

The party goes ashore to help the wounded villagers.  The headwoman spends some time speaking with Valar.  It seems she wants to keep the trireme.  Since it is impractical for the party to take the ship with them, Captain Valar is open to the idea.

While he is busy, some party members search the trireme, free the prisoners manning the oars, and find a few worthwhile goods.  They quickly realize that the ship is filthy, and spilling blood and guts all over hasn't made it much worse than it already was.

[[#Burial]]
**72 Summer 1141, the island of [[Permoso|Per'moso]]**

There is a lot of cleanup to do, slaves to free, and wounds to heal.  A tall wooden carving is recovered from the ship.  At the top is the image of four hands, each fingertip an eye, and an eye on each palm.  At the bottom is a mass of writhing tentacles coming up from what might be the ocean.  Between these two is a fierce-looking bird and a great snake, fighting.  The headwoman, Delma, explains the totem to Aidan and Nadia:

> This is a symbol of our people, and of our gods.  They sky-father is above, and the sea-mother is below.  Between them are their children, Ixtor and Jihigas.  Brother and sister, they fight constantly, opposing each other in every way.  But their struggle gives shape and motion to the world.  The passing of the sun and the moon, the winds that blow first from the East and then from the West, the movement of the tides: all of these are signs of their struggle.  

> We do not believe that one is good and one is evil.  Each represents different things in the world, but neither can exist without the other.  Our lives are always filled with fighting, and what you bring to that fight makes a person good or evil.

The islanders take the carving and put it on the deck, then begin to clean the ship.

The Qargur (a Seer or Shaman) arrives from another village, carried on a chair and obviously wounded.  The village he was staying at was attacked the night before, and that is when the totem was stolen.  Ambrose, after asking permission, heals some of the Quargur's wounds.  The shaman (through Delma, because he doesn't speak Imperial) thanks Ambrose and his foreign gods for how they have helped his people.

Aidan and Nadia show off their horses to the kids.  The adults prepare the dead for burial.

As evening comes, a procession is formed of all the villagers.  Some carry torches, while others carry the dead.  The line of people follows a trail through the thick forest to a beach a couple of miles away, where the sandy beach drops quickly into the sea.  As night falls, drummer place their instruments onto the water and begin to play, at such a volume and with such precision that waves of sound can be seen emanating from the drums out to the sea.  After a while something approaches from the sea visible only as a bulge beneath the water.  It has churned up the sandy bottom in its passing, making it impossible to see. 

Dozens of tentacles slide out of the water to search the shore for the bodies, which the villagers have wrapped in scented wax and broad leaves.  As the creature finds the dead it wraps them each in a tentacle, and drags them into the sea.  When all of them have been taken the Quargur steps into the water and cuts himself with a stone knife, offering his blood to the unseen thing.  It departs the way it came, a huge shape distorting the now-dark water.

The party learns that they have seen a guardian of the sea come to retrieve the dead and protect them until the sea-mother can accept them in the afterlife.  When the new moon comes (which these people call the Quiet Night), those close to the deceased will return to this place to watch the spirits of the dead depart.  They look like glowing fishes, which swim from the reefs to the shore and then back out again, and from there the spirits dive into the deep dark sea, never to be seen again.

Before calling it a night, Valar says that it will take a day to re-provision the ship.

[[#Pearls]]
**73 Summer 1141, still on [[Permoso|Per'moso]]**

Minzerec studies the carving.  He can tell at this point the magic is divine in origin (or at least what he recognizes as the kind of magic commonly believed to be divine) from the divination school.  But it also has some other kind of magic which he can not identify.  The carving itself seems to be made from an unremarkable wood and is not adorned with anything special.

Valar meets with the Quargur, who counts out 300 beautiful pearls, and 40 pearls that are ugly and flawed and misshapen.  The beautiful pearls are for the lives saved, and the flawed ones are for enemies slain.  

Aidan takes Nolan for a ride on her horse, and he feels better.

The party also manages to open the poison-trapped chest.  Inside they find about 400 finger bones, each tied with a loop of thread to a piece of silver.  Valar thinks it is someone's sick idea of trophies.  Aidan takes the silver, and asks the Quargur what should be done with the box (Delma translates again).  He says fire is the best way to purify the remains, and offers to take care of it for her.

Treasure:
> 15,000gp in pearls.  (Valar & Crew takes 5000.)
> 400sp

**74-80 Summer 1141**

The Pharon leaves bright and early and sails for the island of the oracle.  There is a storm, and some people rediscover sea-sickness, but it is nothing Valar and the Pharon can't handle.

[[#Slowly]]
**81-84 Summer 1141, the Far Islands**

The Pharon enters strange waters which are warm, and at times smell of sulfur or stranger things.  In some places, bubbles rise from the sea.  There are brightly-colored fish that the crew has never before seen, and at night and early in the day a heavy mist lies on the water.  Navigation is difficult.

Even with the accurate map provided by Nibbs and the journal, it takes Valar three days to find the right island.  Even so, he won't approach it except under ideal conditions.  On the 84th he anchors his ship on the Northwest side of the island and waits.

[[#Greenrime]]
**85 Summer 1141, the Oracle Island**

Under half-sail and oars the Pharon enters the reefs between the tides, at mid-morning.  The markers depicted in the [[journal|Alamion]] are clearly visible, and the great mountain looms darkly above the misty waters.

The channel passes into a break in the mountain, through which the party can see the caldera that forms the inner part of the island.  Just outside the entrance is a wrecked ship, broken on the reefs as if it had been dropped there by a large wave.  Nolan sees shapes moving in the water around the ship.

The Pharon passes through the crevice and into the lagoon beyond, from whence the canopied jungle can be seen.  The party elects to take the two small launches from the Pharon and investigate the shipwreck.  They hope to find news of Issyren, if she had been on board the ship.  Valar gives four of his men as rowers, but stays with his ship.

The party is attacked by ten lacedons (aquatic ghouls) and three ghasts.  With a lot of help from turning power, the party destroys all of the ghasts and half of the lacedon.  Two of the rowers are hurt and paralyzed, and Minzerec is sick.  Ambrose cures the paralyzing touch, but only after he convinces the party he has to be off the rowboat first.

The party searches the ship, which they now know is the Greenrime.  In the captain's cabin they find the remains of an alchemy lab, the ship's log, and some charts.  The log notes that Issyren was picked up as a passenger in [[Kepharix]], but says nothing else about her.  On a lower deck the party find a cabin containing some of Issyren's better robes, scattered bits of blank parchment, and a few personal items.

The party searches the bilges, too, and discovers what is probably the captain's smuggling hole.  In it are six sealed earthenware pots of what is later identified as [[Black Wyrm]], a pleasure-substance illegal in a lot of places.  Within the smuggling hole Nolan finds another, even smaller compartment.  Tucked away inside are 10 platinum krones.

The party loads up everything useful or valuable they found in the ship onto the rowboats and head back to the Pharon.

XP: 771 @ Fifth level
Treasure:
> 20gp cheap jewelry
> 40 Cutlases (Scimitar, 15gp each == 600gp)
> 20 Shortbows (30gp each == 600gp)

> 6 jars [[Black Wyrm]] paste (undetermined...)

[[#Explore]]
**86-88 Summer 1141, the Caldera**

After some discussions on ways and means, the party sets out in one of the Pharon's launches for the shore.  There is no beach, just a lot of trees growing out the of the water.  They paddle their way through the trees until they find solid ground, and disembark.  The group strikes out in the direction of the spire, cutting their way through the thick jungle.  By the end of the day, they have traveled only four miles, but they have reached the higher slopes of the caldera.

The next morning, after it gets light again, the party searches for any stairway, path, door, or any other visible means to ascend the spire.  Finding none, they climb high enough up the slope to get a good view of the caldera.  Around noon, when most of the mist has burned off, they can see an obvious bulge in the center of the jungle.  They decide to follow [[Alamion]]'s path, and head there.  They spend the rest of the day hacking their way into the jungle, but only make it halfway before night falls.

On the third day, the party pushes onward.  They encounter a truly massive snake, but it seems to be sleeping off a good meal already, and they go around it.  In the afternoon they come to a mile-wide circular hill clear of underbrush, topped with truly massive tree.  The trunk is 100' in diameter, and the lowest branches are 300' in the air.  There seems to be a path made of living wood, circling up the tree.  The top can not be seen from the ground.  The party decides to camp at the base of the tree for the night, and explore the next day.

[[#Penek]]
**89 Summer 1141, the Big Tree**

In the wee hours of the morning, Aidan wakes up the party because she hears something moving down the walkway on the tree.  As people awake, whatever it is runs off.  The party gets dressed and gives chase.  They corner a small human man in ragged clothes, who smells bizarre.  After some food, some threats, and a lot of questions, his story emerges.  Synopsis:

> My name is Panek, and I was first mate on the //Greenrime// under captain Hemfeldt.  We sailed out of Kepharix to do trade in Releven, but stopped at the port of Damanfur along the way.  We took on Magi Issyren as a passenger there, and she must have paid Hemfeldt a ton of money because he transfered much of his cargo and went sailing off into wild waters.  Hemfeldt and the wizard lady got on like fish in water, until we reached the steaming waters.  That's when things started turning bad.

> Hemfeldt got it into his head that the wizard must be after some kind of fabulous treasure, so he decided to try and take it for himself.  He made me poison her drink one night, then he gagged her and put her in mage's shackles to keep her from doing magic.  When she still wouldn't tell him what was so important about the island, the made the crew take turns hurting her.  But still she wouldn't talk.

> When the day came that we found this island, Hemfledt went to her cabin again.  They came back up together, her with her pack and unchained, but he seemed very different.  She had put a spell on him, even with the shackles on, and he did whatever she told him to.  He ran the ship aground on the reef.  Then she killed Hemfeldt and his two bodyguards with lightning.

> She put something in the dead mens' mouths, and they stood up again.  She told them to eat as much as they wanted as long as they didn't kill anybody, and the three unliving men began to attack everyone else on ship.  Issyren destroyed all the launches.  Then she turned into a black sail, and blew away on the wind.

> People got sick from being eaten on by the undead, and when they died they came back as undead.  I only survived because I hid.  After a few days, the waves tossed the //Greenrime// higher up on the reefs and broke her keel.  I escaped out the side of the ship and swam for shore.

The party spends the rest of the day exploring the tree.  People obviously used to live there, but they seem to have taken everything with them when they left.  The sisters decide to spend the night in the crow's nest.

Penek explains his smell: he uses the pulp of a pungent fruit to keep predators away.  Minzerek questions various aspects of Penek's story, probing for inconsistencies.

[[#Resupply]]
**90 Summer 1141**

After a lot of discussion about the Eye of Iyeru, the party realizes that the only red thing thing in the area is the flowers that grow on the higher slopes of the caldera.  Nadia looks at the scroll, and finds the illustration of the deckhand holding flowers -- the same flowers that they saw on the slopes above the jungle.  They decide to head back to the Pharon, drop off Penek, and resupply, then return to their first camping spot.

Since there is a path cut already, the party makes good time and reaches the ship mid-day.

**Continued in [[Autumn1141]]**
