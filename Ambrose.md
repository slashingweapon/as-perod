---

A humble foot soldier in the service of His Grace, Saint Cuthbert of the Cudgel. Praise be to Cuthbert who guides the lost, instructs the feckless, and corrects the foolish.

Despite being somewhat weak of limb and possessing no great agility, Father Ambrose nevertheless can swing a morning star with good effect when the situation demands. His skills as a charismatic orator, diplomat, and sage are well known, as is his ability to provide succor to the sick or injured. Woe be unto those ill-begotten creatures brought back to life without life, for Father Ambrose dispatches them with prejudice.
