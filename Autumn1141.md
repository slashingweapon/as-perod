*Next new moon: **11 Autumn 1141** *

[#Door](#Door.html)
**1-3 Autumn 1141, the Island of the Oracle**

*Today is the Autumnal Equinox.  Not that it matters much in the tropics.*

The party once again sculls their way onshore, ties up the boat, and follows their original path towards the spire.  Once on the slopes they examine the flowers, which they now realize are all pointing in the same direction.  As the day wears on the flowers turn, following the moon.  The party guesses that Tygea's bier will be wherever the flowers are pointing on the night of the new moon, so they begin searching the hillside a mile north of their old camp.

Three days of searching yields a smooth, worked expanse of stone the size and shape of an arched doorway.  Minzerec detects a faint aura of magic, and after some study concludes that some kind of portal spell is in effect there.  At the right trigger, the door will open.

It is eight days until the new moon.

XP: 400 @ 6th level

**5-10 Autumn 1141, the Island of the Oracle**

The days pass peacefully.  There are regular visits by a nest of pseudodragons, which the characters befriend.    They don't speak Imperial, but they begin to learn.  

Valar shows up one day to restock the party's provisions and ask about when the party plans to leave the island.

[#Oracle](#Oracle.html)
**11 Autumn 1141, The Mysterious Door**

At sundown, all of the red flowers are pointing to the mysterious doorway.  All at once, the petals of thousands of flowers open and fold back revealing eye-like centers.  The door is gone, revealing a 4x8' corridor with a barreled vault.  The party enters.

A short distance inside they find a vaulted chamber of smooth stone, empty except for what appears to be a plain stone sarcophagus.  The cover is simply engraved with the figure of a young woman, her hands laying peacefully over her heart.  Around her is carved a fair bit of writing.  Nobody present can recognize it at all.  Minzerec makes a rubbing.

At one end of the chamber is a narrow stair, which disappears into the side of the mountain.  The party begins the long climb, carrying firewood on their backs.

At the end of a long climb they emerge on a flat round-ish plateau over 100' wide.  After a minute to look around they are attacked by a Roc.  The bird picks Basil up in a fly-by attack and tries to throw him off the spire, but Basil tumbles to safety.  Erkey blesses the party, Minzerec does his mirror image thing, and everyone else shoots the Roc.  Basil gets a heal from Erkey.  The Roc comes around for a second pass and nearly kills people with its powerful scream.  Minzerec uses his dizzy ray, and the Roc is forced to belley-flop onto the party, nearly killing Basil again.  Nadia is pinned.  People kill fighting it, until Aidan's axe bites deep and finishes the creature.

After freeing Nadia, the party burns the Roc where it fell.  The smoke rises to the heavens, and a human figure in robes descends the smoke.  It's Issyren (Grandma!).  She invites the party in for tea.  "In" turns out to be some extradimentional space with an excellent view of rapidly-changing sky.  Everyone washes up before tea, and the questioning begins.  Here is her story, linearized...

> I was updating my research using the birth and harvest records of the Central Archives in Maedyn, and I noticed that some of the figures for Strait weren't correct.  I wouldn't have noticed at all, except that Ardengard is part of Strait and I happen to be familiar with the whole county.  I went through the records of the Dutchy of Corak, all the way to the beginning of the project 200 years ago, and made copies.  That was when I found the diary of [Alamion](Alamion.html).  I almost passed it over, but I noticed Ghaucia's name.  I read through it, then went back to what I was doing.

> I went to every county in Corak and looked up the records for the last 200 years.  They did not add up the same as the records in Maedyn.  Someone has been modifying the records, going all the way back to the reformation.  I was alarmed, and started looking at records for the last 20 years in baronies throughout Aspera.  I went back to Maedyn again to compare those to the central records again.  All over the kingdom, the figures aren't just different: they're very different.  

> These new figures were a revelation.  Aspera is slowly but surely dying.  The whole world is dying and it is the Veil that is killing it.  And someone in Maedyn is trying to hide that fact.  I think it is the head archivist, working for the Academy trying to hide what's happening.  He certainly could do it.

> Those of us who study the Veil have searched forever for a kind of thaumaturgical mechanism that we think controls it.  We call it the *Orbis Macchina*.  I've wondered for a long time if it could be controlled, or turned off, or destroyed.  If that would put the world back to the way it was made.  Then I thought of Alamion and his journal.  So I had another look at it, made a few notes, and set off.  It turns out you can't get to these islands by magic.  I had to turn around and go back to Damanfur, to charter a ship.

> I found the doorway, much the same as you did, and asked the Oracle how to find the *Orbis Maccina* and how it could be destroyed.  He told me that the *Maccina* is hidden even from oracles.  He further told me it could only be destroyed at the right time by the appointed people; that my own grandchildren would be among them; and that the task would most likely claim their lives.

> I didn't like his answers, so I killed him and took his place.  Naturally, that has only resulted in a series of events which ties my girls ever closer to their fate.  

There is some more discussion about choice and character, and how Issyren's selection of a mate is likely what started the connection between her bloodline and the Veil.

[#Prophesy](#Prophesy.html)
**The Prophesy**

Then, you know, people wanted the same questions answered.  Where is the mechanism?  Will the Veil be destroyed?  That kind of thing.  Here's her replies, given in a most matter-of-fact grandmotherly style.  No glowing eyes.  No echoing voice.  Nothing awesome at all.

> Those who made the *Orbis Maccina* made sure it could not be found, even by oracles.  It can not be destroyed, except by those to whom the task is given, and not until the time appointed.  You will know the time is near when the following signs appear:  A great tower will fail; A kingdom will be lost; The cleft moon will burn.  

> When these Signs come to pass you know the task is upon you.

She also hands out some "general advice" as to what people must do after the signs occur.

* To Basil: You must begin where [Ghaucia](Ghaucia.html) ended.
* To Minzerec: You will have to decide between the Academy as it sees itself, or the Academy as it really is.
* To Nolan: They Gray Lady knows more about the deep places of Soubous than anyone alive.
* To Ambrose and Erkey: As you do the bidding of your gods, your fate is beyond my influence.

Finally, she gives two books and an envelope to Minzerec.  These contain her research and other information.

After some other chit-chat, she says good-bye and the party finds itself outside the tomb.
