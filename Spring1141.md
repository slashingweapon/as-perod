**90 Spring, 1141** [[#Sandstorm]]

The caravan loses most of a day, hunkering down in the face of a sandstorm.  There are enough experienced people around that survival isn't a problem.

**89 Spring, 1141** [[#Spiders]]

Nadia spots something funny on the road, a couple of round smooth depressions that don't look normal.  Nolan approaches carefully, so he isn't completely surprised when two gigantic spiders pop out of the ground and try to grab him.  He runs away.  The big spiders are accompanied by thousands and thousands of little spiders that pour over the ground and try to each whatever they can reach.

Bazil does a cool flame thing with his swords.  Earthen grasp doesn't work again.  Everyone makes all of their fortitude saves, and Erky hardly has to heal anyone.  When the spiders' lairs are examined, among the bones of various animals is found the fresh corpse of the caravan's scout.  Villheim and some of his people bury the man and perform the necessary rites.

**87 Spring, 1141** [[#Elves]]

The caravan stops mid-day to trade with a band of elves.  There is some light merriment that night, and the players put on one of their shows.  Wine is poured, songs are sung.

The next day there is a new member of the caravan.  Bazil, an elf of indeterminate features, has joined the caravan as part of the guard.  

**82-85 Spring, 1141** [[#Depart]]

The caravan is gathered, and Peter and Barlo both stop by to say their farewells.  Peter spends a few extra minutes with Nadia.

The caravan consists of Villheim, Nordaleen and her three helpers, a grimalkin named grim (fun but talkative), the caravan's scout and about a dozen men-at-arms.  The passengers are the Animogea Players (a ten-person theater troupe) in their two wagons, a young princess of Corak and her retinue (two handmaidens and two riders), and a dark-haired man who pointedly keeps to himself.  Goods are carried by two dozen camels and six wagons drawn by teams of two horses each.

Leaving Maedyn it takes a day to reach the Stairway, a mile-high cliff that is climbed by an endless series of switchbacks.  Two days to climb the stairway, and one more day to reach [[Simbel]] (little more than a military frontier town).  From Simbel the caravan passes through the Gate of Aspera and out into the wilderness.  Villheim explains that from here to Vohanis-controlled territory is five more days, assuming nothing delays the party.

The caravan moves slowly, but the company (if you want it) is mostly good, and the food is excellent.  At night there is often music, and the theater troupe often practices which can be fun to watch.  Even Villheim seems almost pleasant, now that the company is on the road.

**79 Spring 1141 [[Maedyn]]** [[#Journal]]

Dunac arrives for breakfast, and hands over his translation of the last several pages of [[Alamion]]'s journal. There is some speculation about the large missing section in the middle of the journal, the meanings of the verses, and so on. He seems excited about the notion that the party is going in search of this oracle.

Father Ambrose, utilizing his exceptional skills in diplomacy and motive-sensing, and with help from Aidan who soundly thrashes one of the caravan master's guards in a contest of practice blades, secures the party's employment as (surprise!) guards at the rate of 3sp per day per person plus meals (and the meals are promised to be of excellent quality). Word arrives that the caravan leaves in two more days (the 81st).

XP: 200 @ 4th level

**77 Spring 1141 [[Maedyn]]** [[#Consignment]]

Over breakfast, Nolan tells the party that Barlo is in fact the Bey in disguise. They depart for Barlo & Co., and gain admittance to his office. After some verbal sparring, Barlo confesses that he is someone else entirely. His real name is Timeas, son of [[Andronicus]], brother to Baron Iaden of Lemonfall.

He explains that he fell in love with the Princess Jaskira while on his grand tour about 20 years ago, but that her brother Jamyt and her cousin Lemandis disapproved. Add to that an incident where he showed courage while they cowered, and their ire was complete. The two noble-born men framed him for magical crimes, and he was taken to the Arcanist dungeons under [[Soubous]] where he was given the gibbac poison and left to rot.

He remembers very little of his escape, except that he walked for a very long time underground. For over a decade he has lived for revenge, but now finds himself concerned with even greater matters. He thinks Jamyt is hip-deep in some political intrigue to take over the throne.

Barlo/Abbas/Timeas recommends the party talk to Vallheim, the best caravaner currently in the city.

In a combination tea shop / spice trader store, the party offers their services to Vallheim's caravan. He isn't a nice person, but seems to know his business. His ill demeanor is offset some by the more cheerful Nordaleen, his Id-Anian second-in-command and chef. He is skeptical, however, of the girls' abilities to act as guards. Aidan puts his mind at rest by clobbering his man Osman. Vallheim seems cheered up by the impromptu event. The pay is 3s a day for each party member, plus meals and feed for their horses. The departure date is not yet set.

**76 Spring 1141 [[Maedyn]]** [[#Trial]]

Ferrule shows up for breakfast and informs everyone that Lemandis (former Baron of [[Lemonfall]]) is to be tried for heinous murder. The political situation is complicated: the Academy refuses to release any information that might jeopardize secrets of dangerous magic, while the throne refuses to let a baron of prestigious birth rot in an Academy prison. Lemandis has been given the gibbac poison (which dulls or even kills the mind) and the trial proceeds without much evidence. Lemandis' mind is so far gone, it won't matter if he is found innocent.

Just when it looks like the (now-mindless) former baron is about to be reprieved, Barlo arrives in the court with two women in tow. One works at the infamous Blue Fruit in Lemonfall, and testifies that one of her girlfriends (Vanya) had become pregnant by Lemandis, who not only acknowledged the child but moved the mother to another town. Since then, nobody has heard from Vanya even though they have tried to contact her.

The second witness was a midwife who testified as to the manner of Vanya's death. Lemandis killed her during childbirth so he could take the baby from her dead body. This was not the first such attempt, but in this case the baby survived. The midwife went along with his plans only because her own family was being held hostage. She has turned on him now because she has learned her family is in truth dead.

Aidan tries to chat up Barlo, who is known to be the front man for Bey Rabbah in the City. He tries hard to brush her off, yet she persists. He gives her his card.

Lemandis is convicted, and is to be executed that very night.

**73-75 Spring 1141 [[Maedyn]]**

The Rosebud was well-recommended. Besides being comfortable lodgings at entirely reasonable costs, the flatcakes are excellent. Breakfast becomes a regular group event.

The sisters get the expected letter from Uncle Slick, and head for the archives. The Archivist is an old gnome who doesn't like to be disturbed, but he guides them to a sun-deprived young man named Dunac, who seems interested in Alamion. Issyren had come looking at the same document months ago, and he was happy to take a look at it and translate for Aidan and Nadia. He gives them the gist of what's in the journal, and they arrange for a translated copy to be made. 12g for just the latter pages and detailed copies of the drawings on water-resistant materials, to be delivered in six days. 100g for the same treatment of the whole journal, on archival-quality skins. Half is payable up front for materials.

There is some shopping for horses, with help from Peter. Thanks to Peter's contacts, they practically steal a pair of [[Arducian Charger]]s. The horses are trained, but very ornery. It will take several days to get them accustomed to new handlers, ride them around a bit, and take them through their combat maneuvers.

The armor repair costs 400g less than anticipated. It must be due to Nolan's excellent bargaining skills.

Minzerac isn't seen much outside of breakfast. He's enjoying the Arcane Academy library. Outside of Soubous or KhumKhari, this might be the best one in the world.

Role-play XP: 500 @ 4th level

**72 Spring 1141 [[Maedyn]]** [[#Maedyn1]]

The throne city is a very large center of trade, manufacture, and administration. Over 50,000 people call it home, and up to another 15,000 are just passing through at any one time. Ferrule suggests he split from the party, since he still isn't sure advertising the party's association with him is a good idea. Codewords are arranged, and he promises to be in touch. The party enters the city looking as ordinary as they are able, to avoid unnecessary attention by the guards.

The group takes up residence at the Rosebud, a large boarding house with a pub on the ground floor. After a round of the requisite jokes, the party splits up to explore the city and take care of business.

* Nolan - Takes the assassin's armor to be fixed. Meets a man. Gets a job. Makes a killing.
* Aidan and Nadia - wash up, get the horses groomed, and visit Peter (nephew of Count Jaq) to return their fine horses and try to arrange for new ones. He's a handsome young man, in whom his uncle places considerable trust. At night he shows them the town.
* Minzerac - turns in his report. Gets the //ring of mind shielding// registered, and spends his time writing scrolls. Runs into Meako and tells her where to find Erky.
* Erky - is found by Meako. She turns over some uncut gems that were dug out of the giant thoqqua in Verucia (9 * 100g). They avoid religion and get along famously. They go out.

All in all, a fine first day in the Great City for everyone.

**69 Spring 1141 a little past midnight. At [[Rest for the Weary]], a wayside Inn** [[#Assassins]]

Ferrule describes this as "the best roadside inn in the kingdom", but the party gets to see little of it. They take a large, well-appointed suite, order some food, clean their equipment (Nadia does, anyway) and turn in.

Before dawn, Ferrule is attacked in his room by an assassin. Fortunately, he has a long-developed habit of not sleeping in beds where he can be easily killed. The assassin is big, tough, fast, and well-equipped. But between good spell choices by Ambrose and Minzirac, a well-placed hit from Nadia's greatsword and a 20-foot diving power-chop from Aidan (who apparently doesn't mind sprained ankles), he doesn't quite make it to safety.

The would-be killer is half-orc, and his only identifying mark is a black spiraling wrym or dragon encircling his right nipple.

His valuables are:
* +1 shortsword of Frost (extra 1d6 damage when activated)
* +2 leather armor (needs repair before it can be used again)
* +2 amulet of natural armor
* 6 small throwing knives (plus two more stuck in Nadia)
* Ring of mind shielding (unregistered, and therefore contraband)
* potion of cat's grace
* potion of gasseous form
* No money whatsoever

Ferrule doesn't recognize the guy's tattoo, so it might mean nothing or he might be a member of a some new gang or guild. He tells the party not to concern themselves too much with this guy. "People try to kill me from time to time. I'll handle this, you lot worry about Issyren."

XP: 1200 for 4th level characters

**68 Spring 1141, The Road to Maedyn**

A few hour on the road and they come across a small caravan of players, gathered around the remains of one of their own. A father and son were taken, the father was apparently eaten by something (ghouls come to mind) and the son is still missing. Anamogea (playwright) says that there was one "something" and a girl, fitting the description of Orodriel. She knocked him senseless before he could do anything helpful.

The party imposes on Uncle Slick to help track the perpatrators, but he loses them in the rain. They ride on to a wayside inn.

**68 Spring 1141, [[Oxhed]]**

The sisters convince Count Jaq of Reeland to loan them his horses for a little longer, until they reach [[Maedyn]]. He insists they must return the horses to his nephew Peter, who acts as agent for him in the throne city. Jaq gives the sisters a letter of introduction.

Father Ambrose interviews Kelesra. She is obviously devout, in spite of a wound to her shield arm that refuses to heal, even under the touch of the High Priest himself. She thinks that if the gods have chosen to maim her so then it is for a reason, and perhaps she is be meant for something other than fighting in the field. She is willing to serve as the Oridinate of the Church of St. Cuthbert in Newholy. Father Ambrose finds her acceptable.

The party leaves with Ferrule, traveling on the Great Road towards Plover, and then Maedyn.

Roleplaying XP: 500

**67 Spring 1141, The Keep at [[Oxhed]]** [[#Te]]

The party partakes of the [[Rite of Te]], and finds itself in the sacred grove. Hight Priest Danburr, Duke Ferrule (aka Uncle Slick), Duke Endethel of Newholy, Justicar Clausen, some riders, a scribe, and a couple of priestesses (one young, one old) settle down to take counsel. (All matters discussed here receive a large insight bonus - one of the many properties of this space.)

New Rider-Mentors are inducted, a paladin is chosen, and several matters of other import are discussed. A new priestess is suggested for the temple of St. Cuthbert in Newholy. After some discussion, Rider Kelesra is suggested as a possible Ordiante for the new church.

The matters of Lemandis and Verucia are discussed, and quite a bit of resentment is expressed about the Academy's role in both of these matters. Justicar Clausen will demand custody of Lemandis from the Academy so he can be properly tried and punished by the correct authorities.

The party learns more about Issyren's project, that she was in the last stages of a 100 year-old research project aimed at convincing the Academy to destroy the Veil. The project was begun by Tygar the Reformer before the reconstruction, and has been handed down to several generations since. Her project books must be recovered. There is also conjecture that someone in the Archives might be altering the aggregate statistics reported by the baronies.

The oracle (via Priestess Innita) speaks:

> The magi Issyren has passed from mortal sight
> yet lives and breathes on far-seeing spire;
> An aerie of wyrd below whose unscal'd height
> lies sprawled the jeweled isles of mighty Kord.

The party figures Issyren must be on a mountainous isle somewhere off the west coast of [[Releven]]. Mother Wopius wakes up (she's been snoozing through most of the meeting) and says it sounds like Alamion's oracle. She doesn't remember much about him, except that he traveled with [[Ghaucia]], they wanted to destroy the Veil, but they were told by the oracles to leave that task for a later generation.

**66 Spring 1141, [[Oxhed]]** [[#oxhed]]

Oxhed is like one giant carnival during the choosing. People are camped all over the valley below the town proper, and impromptu contests of martial prowess abound. Thousands of riders are gathered here, as are many of the nobles that they serve. Pennants from all of the Dukes and many counts are easy to spot. Merchants and entertainers have also come in abundance to try and pry some coin from the gathered riders.

The party finds Count Jaq, and there is something of a reunion between him and his horses. Jaq says to come to dinner and he'll also invite Issyren's other old comrades from her adventuring days: High Priest Danburr and Ferrule "Lightfingers" Lighthammer (known to the sisters as "Uncle Slick"). That night a lot of stories are told (some of them a tad ribald) about Issyren's youth and their days of traveling around the world.

Danburr says that Issyren had been working for years on a theory that the Veil was slowly killing the world, and that he was worried about her disappearance. He says the party should attend the [[Rite of Te]] the next day (the day of the new moon) and perhaps they would be favored by the Oracle. "It is best not to expect too much," says Danburr, "the goddess reveals little, except at the worst of times."

**58 Spring 1141, Newholy**

The party arrives, gets cleaned up, visits the Bey's house (he is not at home) to pick up their things. Makil produces a large quantity of coins, which he says is from the collection on the night of the party. Father Ambrose makes the appropriate arrangements for the money, and the party leaves for [[Oxhed]].

**56 Spring 1141, Verucia**

In the wee hours of the morning, as the moon goes down, the area of destruction starts growing until it threatens to overtake the windmill. The party retreats. At about the same time, Captain Gorem arrives with 40 horse, 120 foot, and a Magi named Uster.

At a brief council, Gorem, Uster, Akerdell, and the party discuss what is to be done. Uster explains that all this trouble is due to demons attacking the world and creating a hole in space through which chaos can enter. Uster's team of wizards will close the hole, while the party and Gorem's best fighters defend them. The regular troops will stand back in reserve. "When you close a hole this big," says Uster, "something big usually comes out of it at the last minute." Akerdell refuses to help, even though the event happened practically on top of his tower. He's too afraid.

Uster and Minzerac take a walk and have a private chat. Uster lets Minzerac borrow his staff, telling him it has the power to dismiss elementals and give protection against elements (among other things).

Uster's team arrives, and the closing ritual begins. Uster and each of his wizards wields a rod tuned to a different element, and they surround the event and concentrate. Nothing seems to happen at first, but then some thoqqua appear and attack the wizards. The party defeats them handily.

After a few more minutes two more thoqqua appear, but these are gigantic. One of them immediately attacks one of Uster's wizards (a pretty gnome female named Meako) and tries to burn her alive. Nadia and Erky go to her rescue, since Gorem's men are being completely ineffectual against it. Aidan and Minzerac face off against the other one. After much fighting, and nearly getting two of Count Jaq's horses burnt to a crisp, the party is victorious and Meako is saved. Soon after, the rift closes with a thunderous noise.

At the party's urging, Erky reluctantly talks to Meako but without much success. It takes them about one minute to get into a religious argument. Erky, with his keen wisdom score, divines that "it wouldn't work out".

The party elects to retire to Newholy to retrieve their things, which were left behind hastily.

**55 Spring 1141** [[#verucia]]

After riding through the night and well into the next day, the party finds Verucia and environs riddled with elemental damage, and shell-shocked people carting their few belongings away from the area. After a close call with some quicksand-like substance, the party approaches the town proper.

The town windmill, which is located on a hill a couple hundred yards from the pallisade, provides a good vantage point to look into Verucia. There are few building left standing, and the pallisade that used to surround the town is utterly destroyed. The whole north-east section of town looks like it was turned into a horizontal mudslide. Aside from almost total devastation, they can see a ball of shifting energy in the air about 40' above the town which seems to be the center of much of the activity.

The party stops some looters, and rather pointlessly tries to gain information from them. They don't know any more about what has happened than the party does. They do manage to learn that the tower near the center of town is where is the Academy GP lives, and his name is Akerdel. Aidan grills a looter for a while demanding more information on the wizard, but the looter insist he doesn't know the guy personally and knows nothing of the wizard's doings. There is an earthquake, and 10' crevace opens up, into which falls four of the looters, Ambrose, Erky, and Erky's horse. The rest of the looters run away while the party rescues the people who fell. The wagon full of looted stuff proves to be useful after all.

Aidan and Nadia go looking for the large humanoid thing they spied skulking around town from the windmill, and creep up on a giant-sized humanoid-shaped thing made of mud and rocks munching on a building. They decide to leave it alone. Ambrose thinks the party should leave it alone. For some reason they discuss it for a long time. The creature is left to its building buffet in peace.

The party heads to the Akerdel's tower. They find a small girl, June, barely alive under some debris inside the schoolroom. The wizard himself is in his bedroom, webbed into his bed by icesilk spiders. The have apparently been snacking on him since the previous night. The party rescues the wizard, who is quite near death. Aidan jumps into bed with him, and he perks right up. He confesses himself to be one very lucky gnome.

Akerdel is visibly upset about the destruction of his entire third floor, which housed his workshop. He claims to have no idea what is causing the swirling vortex of elemental destruction above the town. The party makes a second report to Prince Jamyt via the protean quartz, and withdraws to the windmill to watch over the town until the main fighting force shows up.

> **600xp for 4th level characters.**

**54 Spring 1141**

During the party, a series of lights and strange noises from over the horizon disrupt the party. Shockwaves shake the windows. After several minutes of this lightshow, Prince Jamyt (who is attending the party) closets himself and some advisers in a bedroom and calls for Nadia and Aidan.

The Prince explains that whatever is happening, is happening in the town of Verucia some fifty miles distant. As many of his best people are in Oxhed for the choosing, he needs some capable people to recon and report back using a Protean quartz.

Nolan also receives a mission, discretely, to retrieve a certain box.

**53 Spring 1141, [[Newholy(City)]]** [[#countryhouse]]

The party arrives in Newholy. Ambrose checks on his man Barnaby and the progress of the temple, then the party heads towards Bey Rabbah's new "country house" a few miles out of town. After they finish gawking, they are granted an audience. He invites the group to his grand housewarming party, an affair of special extravagance. Rabbah also agrees to hold a collection for the new temple, largely because it will upset the Prince.

**50 Spring 1141, Lemonfall** [[#iaden]]

The party arrives in Lemonfall and is greeted by Iaden. She invites them to dinner. The group kills time at the Blue Fruit. They learn a little more than they wanted to about one of the girls there. Quarlie was a favorite of his, and she's glad he won't be around any more. Although she does mention he can't be all bad, since he put Leyana in a house in Turyr after she got pregnant. Aidan tries to convince Quarlie that the Baron *is* all bad.

Dinner at Iaden's is a lively affair. She is the interim Baroness and she seems confident of gaining the position permanently. She has other house guests, a delegation of elves (led by one named Adonya), who are pleased that the elves will be cleared of suspicion in the deaths of Ospheros, Penymos, and Victor. According to his journal, Lemandis had his father Ospheros killed while the man was out hunting and made it looks like elves did it. Victor and Penymos also died from the attack. This cleared the way for Lemandi's ascention to the post of Baron.)

Iaden surprises Minzerac by guessing the title of the forbidden book found in Lemandi's lodge. "Twenty years ago Lemandis, Victor, and my brother Timeas went to Soubous to compete in the wine tasing there. My brother was imprisoned by the Academy for carrying a scrap of paper copied from that book. He died in an Academy prison, and it was his death that broke my father's heart. It took us years just to get the academy to tell us why they took him. Now I know where that paper came from, it was Lemandis' doing though I don't know why. Now Lemandis will get some measure of what he did to my brother."

Baroness Iaden gives to Father Ambrose a letter from the Princess Jaskira, thanking him for his efforts. Enclosed is a copy of the leashold to the shrine site in Newholy. Also, she presents the party with a small strongbox containing 50 pounds of gold (2500gp). "Getting rid of Lemandis was the best thing that could have happened to the valley. The people here are in much better hands now, I promise you."

The party gains **2000xp each** (for 4th level characters).

**47 Spring 1141, Thrace**

The party spends another day doing much the same thing they did the day before, only this time talking to Academy enforcers. The two riders who were with the Baron are released that evening. The next morning, the party sets out for Lemonfall.

**47 Spring 1141, Thrace** [[#thrace]]

The party arrives in Thrace, with their three captives in tow. They spend most of the day talking to the resident GP about Lemandis and Orodriel. They seem especially concerned about the escaped girl, but sound confident they will catch her.

Aidan writes a letter to Baronet Iaden explaining the basics of what happened.

**46 Spring 1141, a hunting lodge in Angsul Forest (cont)**

In the no-longer-secret passage the party finds the Baron's summoning room, which is the site of a naturaly occuring hole between the Prime Material plane and the plane of Shadow. Much of his activities here are explained by his [[Journal of Shadows|journal]] and the book [[Secrets of the Grave]] but involve planar travel, consorting with demons, and murder. Minzerac confiscates both books in quick order.

After some discussion the party agrees to take Lemandis and his two riders to Thrace, which has the nearest Academy campus of any size. Aidan argues for taking them to Lemonfall, but Minzerac insists the Academy get its hands on Lemandis as soon as possible, and that the party's duty to Iaden is accomplished either way.

**46 Spring 1141, a hunting lodge in Angsul Forest (cont)** [[#lemandis]]

After midnight Nolan is strongly encouraged to sneak upstairs and investigate the room used by Fashrin. While he is doing this, three heavily armed people (two humans and a halfling) on horses ride up to the house. Erkey (who is on watch while Nolan makes the attempt on Fashrin's bedroom) wakes everyone. Minzerac opens the door to greet the strangers when he is attacked and seriously wounded.

A vicious melee ensues. Nadia takes on the lead human (who wears a mask) while Minzerac retreats. Aidan takes down the other human then helps Nadia. Erkey squares off with the halfling. There are the sounds of fighting from upstairs. Then two gray-cloaked wights enter through a secret passageway at the back of the house and attack Father Ambrose. Ambrose attempts to turn the "ABOMINATIONS!", but they are bolstered by Ora (who is on the upstairs balcony looking down in the fight).

Nadia nearly sunders the masked fighter's weapon, while Aidan pounds on him in a more direct fashion. Erkey survives his bitter halfling grudgematch to emerge victorious. Father Ambrose takes a hit from a wight but does not suffer from their dreaded energy drain. Minzerac bravely fights by his side to no visible effect. Ambrose's second turn attempt succeeds and the wights begin to run. Minzerac blocks the secret door behind them with whatever he can find.

The masked fighter calls for Ora to come help, but is struck down. As soon as that is done Aidan rushes to the stairs to head off Ora's anticipated escape. She drops from the balcony on the other side, then runs out through the root cellar. Several party members follow, with Father Ambrose in the lead. Ora leaves the cellar through the outside door (which she previously claimed was broken) and closes it behind her. Father Ambrose follows her and is hit with an explosion of fire, seriously wounding him.

Nadia pushes past burnt Ambrose to pursue Orodriel and is just in time to see her rapidly ascending up the cliff face, tied to a counter-weighted rope. In just a couple of seconds, Ora is on top of the cliff and away.

Erkey stablizes the wounded. The masked fighter is revealed (Baron Lemandis! And he would have gotten away with it too...). Minzerac blocks the secret passage. Aidan discovers Nolan upstairs unconscious and brings him around.

**45 Spring 1141, the North Slopes of the Angsul Forest** [[#crypt]]

As the mysterious figure in gray runs away Minzerac hears a voice on the telepathy stone saying, "Someone has beaten the guardian. We're going into the tunnel."

The party explores the ravine. They find a crypt in the middle area, and at the far end of the ravine they find an iron door. Nolan can't do anything with the lock, and attempts to shoulder it down fail.

The party turns their attention to the crypt, which seems empty but well-maintained. Four bare stone slabs atop simple stone coffins are the only feature of the room. With some effort (and a crowbar) they slide the tops aside. They find odds and ends, clothes and tools and pots and pans and backpacks and saddlebags, all neatly folded and put away. Having been kept in a cool dry place there is little sign of decay. There is nothing that obviously identifies anyone, but the party takes a monogrammed shirt ("KM") and a set of masterwork tools of gnomish/halfling size.

The party decides to try their luck on the hilltop, to search for an exit for the tunnel. After an hour or two they discover, a few hundred yards away from the crevace, a sheer drop-off about 70' down. At the bottom of the cliff is a building. It is a two-story stone house with thatched roof set against the cliff face, with an acre of vegetable garden and fruit trees, a couple hundred feet of cleared space out to the forest, and a few sheep. There is a human girl practicing acrobatics in the yard.

They go around and down the hill and hail the house, where they are welcomed. Introductions are made, questions are asked, and meals are eaten. The girl's name is Orodriel, and she is an orphan from Thrace county. She has a mentor/benefactor whose face she has never seen, but who gives her this place to live and sends tutors and companions out to her. One of those occasional companions is Fashrin. When she hears of his lycanthropy and death, she is visibly upset. She seems well-educated, gracious, and plays a little guitar (she is not especially good).

Orodriel (Ora to her friends) invites the party to stay the night.

**45 Spring 1141, the North Slopes of the Angul Forest**

In the pre-dawn hours, the camp is attacked by undead. Erkey wakes the camp and tries to turn the undead, but they are too strong for him. Although the undead have the advantage, they fail to actually hurt anyone in the first moments of combat. Father Ambrose has better luck turning them, and the fighters in the party chase down the undead and dispatch the wights. The bodies are searched, but nothing useful, identifying, or valuable is found. The bodies are disposed of by burning them.

After dawn the party breaks camp and continues following the trail until they come to a crevice. There they are attacked by vicious plantlife that nearly kills both Nolan and Minzerac. Nolan in particular has a hard time of it, being bent in half and compressed in ways not intended by his creator. He very nearly dies.

After some serious healing, the group proceeds along the ravine until they come to a large troll skeleton that is chained to a rock. He attacks when Nadia attempts to get past him. There's quite a bit of shuffling around in the narrow confines of the ravine, but everyone has a chance to get their licks in and pulverize it.

As the troll falls, Minzerac spies a gray-cloaked figure retreating farther into the ravine.

**44 Spring 1141, [[Lemonfall]] and the north road**

After spending the night at the Blue Fruit tavern, the party informs the Baronet they will accept her offer. She gives them a letter of introduction to Sylas (her old and soon-to-be-retired huntsman) who will help them find the lodge, rights of salvage, and permission to search Fashrin's cabin.

They visit Sylas' house, where they find a disheveled and somewhat fragrant man who has clearly seen better days. It doesn't take him long to read the letter and pack his things. He is clearly upset at the news of Fashrin's death, as it may delay his own retirement. He is, as Father Ambrose notes later, a "maintenance drinker".

At Fashrin's house the party finds 15g, a [[protean quartz]] that has been enchanted for use as a telepathy stone, a +1 battleaxe, a chain shirt and helmet, and various letters from [[Turyr]] and [[Thrace]] pertaining to the payment/shipment/delivery of various building materials. Behind a lose stone of the fireplace Father Ambrose finds a bag with 120pp.

From there the party heads north along the road and over the hills to an area commonly called the "north slopes", which takes most of the day. Sylas finds a trail that he thinks will lead to one of the several hunting lodges in the area. It is hardly more than a game trail, but widens as the party follows it. Near nightfall they come to a fork in the trail, and decide to settle in for the night.

**43 Spring 1141, [[Lemonfall]]** [[#lemonfall]]

The party arrives in Lemonfall in the early evening. The sherrif identifies the werewolf's (human) head as that of Fashrin, a hunter who lives alone and has a reputation for fighting and abuse. He's been punished a few times, but never severely. He speculates that the man won't be missed. Aidan goes with the sherriff to examine the man's house, but nobody finds anything interesting.

Meanwhile, Minzerac has located the town healer Hirisu. She tells him that Nadia is in danger of catching lycanthropy from the bite she received. She must take belladona, a poison, which might prevent her infection. Minzerac fetches Nadia and the Night of Ickyness begins for her. //Symptoms of belladona poisoning include dilated pupils, tachycardia, hallucinations, blurred vision, loss of balance, a feeling of flight, staggering, a sense of suffocation, paleness followed by a red rash, flushing, husky voice, extremely dry throat, constipation, urinary retention, and confusion.// Hirisu's companion, a Greymalkin she calls "Bobby", tries to entertain the guests with lots of shapechanging.

Father Ambrose and Nolan accompany Abbey to the Baronet's house, where Abbey and Iaden speak in private for quite some time. Aidan joins them after she finishes with Fashrin's house. Eventually they are granted an audience with the Baronet. She offers them some minimal refreshment, but is eager to hear how they recovered the sword.

Iaden explains that she grew up with Avadur, and sponsored him so he could be a Rider. He was a very promising young man, and had spent the last two years serving the Duke of Newholy. He returned to the barony during the winter to help with an ogre problem, and was so victorious that the Baron commissioned a special sword to mark the occasion. "This sword," she says, "is the key to whatever killed him."

Iaden suspects her husband is responsible for Avadur's death, and needs to know the truth. Her facts are these:

* Baron Lemandis took the newly-forged sword with him when he went hunting for a week. When Lemandis returned, the sword was magical.
* Avadur's new sword was powerfully magical when he received it, yet when it was recovered it was no longer magical.
* The sword came into the possession of Prince Jamyt, who sent it to be re-enchanted. His sister Princess Jaskira intercepted it. Her suspicions were peaked, so she sent Abbey to Lemonfall.
* The sword lacks any arcane mark of the person who originally enchanted it.
* The baron used to keep a hunting lodge somewhere beyond the north hills. He still uses it occasionally, but Iaden has never been there and doesn't know exactly where it is.
* There have been several disappearances from the north road to Saltdown in the last year, and people are becoming afraid.

Iaden says that she and Jiskira will guarantee the acquisition of the plot of land in Newholy for the new shrine of St. Cuthbert in return for a service. Her request is this:

> //Find this hunting lodge if you can and record any facts that you discover. I want to know if my husband was there with Avadur's sword and, if so, what he was doing. If you find evil or lawlessness there, deal with it as you see fit. I give you rights of salvage to anything that clearly doesn't belong to mine or the Baron's house.//

Abbey is clearly upset by these proceedings, and suggests that even Prince Jamyt might be involved. Why he would do such a thing is a mystery. She refuses to answer any questions about her or Jiskira's connection (if any) to Avadur.

Aidan asks why she would be willing to risk angering her husband, and what she has against the man. Strangely, Iaden is more concerned about the confidentiality of her response to that question than she is about anything else she's said so far. She explains that her marriage is one of convenience. Her father founded Lemonfall, and the current baron nearly ruined it during the few years he ran the town on his own. She married him so she could administer affairs as she sees fit, get the valley back on its feet again, and protect her father's legacy. Her husband spends as little time in the barony as he lawfully can, but gets all the benefits of his title. Their arrangement has been satisfactory so far, but if he murdered Avadur then she can not overlook it and he must be held to account.

> **culture note** The title "Baron" belongs to Iaden's husband Lemandis, and she only has rank through her marriage to him. That is why Iaden is a "baronet" as opposed to a "baroness".

**42 Spring 1141, The North Road and [[Lemonfall]]** [[#werewolf]]

Abbey shows up the next morning more heavily armored and with her bow strung. The party strikes north along the North Road and heads over a pass to the next valley. Coming down the pass and into the forest they are attacked by two dire wolves.

Ambrose blesses the party. Abbey shoots and misses. Aidan and Nadia ride out to meet the wolves. Minzerac casts a spell but the wolf is unaffected. Then a werewolf joins the fray and bites Nadia. Abbey tries to ride around and shoot, but is too close to the wolves -- one of them pulls her down off her horse. The werewolf inexplicably goes for the sword, which is firmly tied to the saddle.

Much riding, shooting, spell-casting, and biting ensues. At the end the werewolf has the sword and tries to run, but is run down by the party. Minzerac presses the party to show no mercy. Even after he is unconcious, the beast is difficult to finish off. They take his head (now in human form) and burn the rest of his naked body along with the dire wolves. Amazingly, nobody is gravely hurt.

Father Ambrose presses Abbey for an explanation, seeing as how the party just saved her life. She reveals that the sword she is carrying is the same one the party recovered from undead just days ago. It belonged to a rider named Avadur. She won't say any more than that until after she delivers her message to the Baronet.

**41 Spring 1141, The road to [[Turyr]]**

Party meets Abbey, who wears a veil and dresses mainly in black. She rides a good warhorse, and is armed with a horsebow and a sword whose scabbard and handle is wrapped in black linen. She doesn't like questions, and says very little about her mission except that she has a message for the Baronete of Lemonfall. The party heads southwest initially, on the road to Rotherford. Once out of sight of the city they cut north to the northwest road to Turyr.

The ride is fast but uneventful. The party decides against pushing their mounts too hard, since they aren't using post-horses and the mounts they have belong to someone else. The party arrives in Turyr late that night and stay at one of the inns outlying the city proper. Nadia and Aidan compete for who is most attentive to their horses. More probing of Abbey, who goes to bed early.

**41 Spring 1141, [[Newholy(City)]] cont** [[#abbey]]

On their way out of town the party receives the following letter from Princess Jaskira.

> //Princess Jaskira daughter of Duke Endethel welcomes their holy graces and all who travel with them.//
> //It is known to me that you go to Oxhed to seek an audience with my father the Duke. It is my wish that you take the north-west road through Turyr and Lemonfall. It will not cost you many days to take this route, and it will afford you the opportunity to perform a service for me. My trusted servant Abbey Westlock bears a message for the Baronet Iaden in Lemonfall. She waits for you on the road a bowshot beyond the northwest gate, and will make herself known by the words "Where do the gods go, so heavily armed and armored?" in exactly those words.//
> //Do this thing for me, and you will have my gratitude. I depend on your speed and discretion.//


**41 Spring 1141, [[Newholy(City)]]**

The party visits [[Rabah]] again with a request for aid. He claims he is willing to assist, but that it is more fitting for the worshipers to build their own shrine. He is asked if the Prince might see reason, to which he replies the Prince doesn't care much for the poor and the low-born, and is not a pious man. He claims to know less about the Prince's wife, [[Saharta]].

[[Ambrose]] is determined to find a way to pay for the land. After some talk, the party decides to appeal to the Prince's father, Duke Endethel. The group decides to leave the City of Newholy immediately and travel to [[Oxhed]], where they know the Duke to be going.

**40 Spring 1141, [[Newholy(City)]]** [[#shrine1]]

The Bey is gracious in his welcome, and invites the company to breakfast on his second-floor veranda overlooking Tygar Square, a major hub of the outer city. The centerpiece of the meal is fruit from the four corners of As-Perod, all of it as fresh as if it had been picked yesterday. Punishment day commences in the square, which culminates in the amputation of a corrupt official and the beheading of a kidnapper. Some of the adventurers express dismay, while the Bey remarks that he is hardened to such sights.

During the party's ruminations on crime, punishment, and philosophy Makyil brings word that commoners are trying to erect a shrine to St. Cuthbert in the inner city. The party takes their leave to have a look. A large group of people are in fact erecting a structure on a small triangular lot sandwiched between several packed tenement buildings. They are angry that Prince [[Jamyt]] has torn down the places of worship during his renovation of Newholy but has not erected any new buildings in their place. Emboldened by the presence and actions of a real priest in their midst, and urged on by one [[Enril Odane]], they have organized to start construction on a lot that the Prince has left empty for three years.

Then the prince arrives with armed men. Ambrose not only forestalls a violent conflict, but wins a small concession: the peasants can build their shrine if they can pay for the leasehold on the land. Some discussion on ways and means ensues, and the shrine is off to a promising start when Nolan and Aidan catch a pick-pocket who had been working the crowd. They empty his pockets for him but otherwise leave him mostly unharmed.

Ambrose tries to sort out what money and talent is available among the would-be builders while [[Minzerac]] and [[Nolan]] spend a quiet afternoon at the recorder's office. The price to acquire the land and rights is 2,500gp. More discussion on ways and means.

Minzerac uses the rest of the day to check in with the Academy.

**39 Sprint 1141, [[Newholy(City)]] continued** [[#badhost]]

There is nobody of note at Prince [[Jamyt]]'s home to greet the adventurers. The party is very well taken care of and provided with every amenity they could want. Since they have no clothes but those on their backs, tailors and dressmakers are summoned to fit them in something suitable. There is a memorable exchange wherein [[Ambrose|Father Ambrose]] is required to assert the sanctity of his clothing in no uncertain terms.

Dinner is an odd affair because the host is not present, and neither is the lady of the house [[Saharta|Princess Saharta]]. They are entertained by the minstrel Gilmore, who also arranges a box at the theater that same night.

During intermission the party receives an invitation from the Bey [[Rabah]] al Hannah to join him for breakfast the next morning, during which Punishment Day may be conveniently viewed.

After the play the party tries one of the taverns that cater to the wealthy, but Abrose reminds them that they have better things to do with their time. They retire for the evening.

**39 Spring 1141, [[Newholy(City)]]**

PCs awake to find a short line out the front door of the Inn of people wanting various religious services and healings. Among them is a daughter of the Lyenal family. Ambrose deals with most of them while Erky and the twins leave to take care of Eldray Lyenal who has become ill from contact with the ghast. With Aidan's assistance and a newly-purchased healer's kit they do their best for the child.

Upon return to the Inn the party finds all of their things have been packed for them and the Lieutenant informs them they will be staying at the private residence of Prince Jamyt, son of the duke of Newholy. He appologizes profusely for not treating such distinguished guests with more hospitality. The Inn's bill is paid in full.

**38 Spring 1141, on the road to [[Newholy]]** [[#undead]]

Party comes upon a pack of undead attacking a merchant wagon (the Lyenal family and two servants). Mostly skeletons and zombies, with two ghasts that were riders in life. Father Ambrose and Erkey manage to turn most of them, but two stonger undead, one human and the other a halfling, stay and fight. Both are easily destroyed by the awsome combined might of Aidan's and Nadia's cleave. The party is aided at the end by a dozen splendidly outfitted half-orcs. After the battle Nadia accidentally challenges one to contest, which she wins. Nolan takes the armor, swords, and personal effects off of the ghasts. All the bodies of the undead are burned. One of the civilians was killed, and he was taken back to town by his family.

The orcs do not speak except to cheer in combat. Their apparent spokesman is a human dressed in fine nobleman's clothing name Makyil, who explains that he and the half-orcs serve the Bey Rabbah al Hannah. They are going to [[Newholy]] to prepare a house for their master. The half-orcs are of the Blackdown tribe somewhere in the Hightable. The tribe has pledged one dozen warriors to the Bey as tribute and out of respect. Makyil speaks at length about the magnificence of the Bey, and asks many questions of the party, especially of the twins. If the party is in town for a few days Makyil promises to be in touch with them again.

Once in town the party goes to the acting Captain of the Guard in an attempt to identify the dead riders. He thinks the halfling's sword might have belonged to Oldaway, and he hasn't a clue about the other. He takes the weapons and armor and promises to find out if he can. The insignia from tunics are from the barony of [[Lemonfall]]. The lieutenant recommends the Swaying Woods as a decent inn that is not unreputable. The party retires for the night.
