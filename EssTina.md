Ess'Tina is a federation of small human nations.  They band together against occasional threats from goblinoids, [Releven](Releven.html) outlaws, or the [sea people](sea people.html), but otherwise exist in a peace with each other.  Trade thrives between these nations, with lowland crops migrating up the mountains in exchange for the textiles and occasional gems that flow back down.  The highland and lowland people both trade with Releven merchants for manufactured goods, mostly ones made of metal.

Although it was once a principality of the Empire, much of Ess'Tina has shrugged off the marks that the Empire left on the rest of the world.  There are a few large towns situated by good ports and roads that resemble the Empire-inspired cities in [Soubous](Soubous.html), [Releven](Releven.html), and [Aspera](Aspera.html), but these are few and far between.  The rest of the region looks and operates much as it did before the arrival of [Mosyph](Mosyph.html).

= Geography =

Ess'Tina stretches north and west of the Stavengar, stretching from the Longhort range in the east to the west shore.

Unlike the huge peaks in [E'Syris|EShyris](E'Syris|EShyris.html), the Longhort north of the strait are not nearly so impassible.  A great many of the mountains in the southern part of the peninsula have flattened tops, as if the mountains had caved in long ago, or had been leveled.  While by no means tiny, these peaks do not prevent rain and snow from passing west to the shore, making the coast far more habitable than in E'Syris, even pleaaant.  What's more, the western rise of the mountains isn't nearly so precipitous as the southern range.
