## Overview 

The fabled City of Towers is not the largest city in the principalities, and it may or may not be the wealthiest, but it is undeniably the most wonderous.  It is said there are more extraordinary sights in this one city than there are in all other great cities of the world combined.  Deep wells that gush clean water on demand, carriages enchanted to drive themselves without horses, robes that change color, awe-inspiring towers and domes, giant gates bound in adamantium that open and close at a word from the guard captain, are all just a few of the wonders commmonly seen in KhumKhari.

The city is ruled by the Council of Mage Lords, the same body that governs the Arcane Academy, through the person of the Vice-Chancellor of the city.  The city and the environs around it are a micronation within the boundaries of [Ososia](Ososia.html), which tolerates the mage city because of the prestige and security it brings.

Entry into the city is tightly controlled.  All citizens wear a medallion, which indicates their rank and grants them passage through the city gates.  Anyone not bearing such a medallion is subject to questioning and searching.  Non-citizens of the city have their hands magically marked, which permits them only so many days of stay in the city (usually 24 hours).  When the mark turns black, the person has overstayed and is subject to being summarily tossed out the gate or even imprisoned.  Medallions are presented to the neighborhood authorities every 100 days for examination.

## History 

KhumKhari is the site of the second arcane library, established by [Mosyph](Mosyph.html) as part of his treaty with  Irius and Rilatia, the monarchs who delivered [Ososia](Ososia.html) to him without a fight.  The generous amount of space allocated to the campus site made it the ideal choice for the main library.  After the ten year conquest construction started in earnest, and by the time of [Sidir](Sidir.html) it looked much as it does today. 

At it's height KhumKhari was bursting at the seams and beyond the city wall was a number of hamlets and farms that helped produce food for the city.  It has been slowly shrinking for the last few hundred years.  However, it does a better job than most cities of hiding it.  Vacant buildings are repurposed or razed before they become eyesores.  The outlying hamlets have been dismantled and the people there moved into the city proper.  Much of the campus proper is occupied the non-arcanists who help administer Academy affairs.

## Geography 

The entire city is located in the perfect center of a perfectly flat, perfectly square plane five miles square.  These twenty-five square miles are clearly marked by a series of stone sentinels eight feet tall at one-hundred-foot increments, all facing outward.  Nearly all of the streets and buildings have a strict north/south or east/west orientation.  

The focal point of the city is the academy "home campus".  The campus houses the Great Library, the Council of Mage Lords, and the entire educational, reasearch, and administrative structure of the [Arcane Academy](Arcane Academy.html).  The campus is ringed by a thick defensive wall punctuated by eight gates: two in each cardinal direction.  Within the wall are six towers of the educational establishment and the dauntingly huge Chancellor's tower.  Other buildings on the campus house various mages who live at the Academy's expense, Academy ministries and workshops, and establishments that cater to them.  Entry to this part of the city is quite free -- it is the towers that are heavily guarded and warded.

Outside the campus wall lies the rest of the city, which exists to service the ten thousand or so denizens of the campus.  Some areas are filled with the homes of the wealthier mages or those who have grown rich trading in arcane materials.  Other areas house the working people and their shops, most of whom do something related to supplying the academy with necessary goods or luxuries.  Finally, there is a thriving marketplace and caravan staging area where goods and raw materials arrive from all over As-Perod.  The entire outer city is surrounded by a modest wall designed less for military defense than as a border.

Between the outer city wall and the sentinel border is a wide swath of park-like grassland and stands of trees.  Occasional large circular paved areas are used for types of training that require lots of space and nothing flamable in the area.

## Culture 

### Arcane Population 

In all the world there are only about 20,000 arcanists (including wizards, sorcerers, and bards).  At any one time about a fifth of that is in residence in KhumKhari.

### Society 

KhumKhari society is stratisfied into three general categories along lines of usefulness to the Academy, each layer having it's own citizenship medallion which grants them passage through the gates of the city.  Arcanists occupy the top tier, and present a silver medalion with a red stone.  Sages, teachers, bureaucrats, and others who work directly for the Academy present a silver medalion with a white stone.  Everyone else in the city presents a copper medallion.  

The Academy is a meritocracy that values knowledge and mental discipline, which is reflected in the culture of the city.  Pleasures like fine art and music are more popular than sports.  Wealth displays itself far less in dress and jewelry than in other cultures, which would be considered grossly foppish by City standards.  Instead, the wealthy show off by commissioning unusual magical items, building collections of historical or archeological interest, patronizing sages, or funding archeological explorations.

Protocol is crucial, just as in other parts of the empire, but in KhumKhari it takes a form less ornate and more strictly functional.  Every notable house retains a protocol expert either directly or through one of the Administration Guild approved offices.  When attempting to gain an audience with a Mage or wealthy individual that one doesn't already know socially, it is a good idea to visit your local protocol professional first.  If one plans to live in the city indefinitely, retaining someone from a reputable administration firm is a necessity.
