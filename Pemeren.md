Pemeren's origins are a complete mystery, but his known history starts during the Elven Harmonium.  

It was during this century of exile that he founded old country of Ustolia, forging a compact between the human inhabitants of the agricultural plains and the various elves and fey living in the surrounding forests, principally the nymph Lupula.
