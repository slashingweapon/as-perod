title: Releven
---

Releven is a confederation of ten city-states spread over the Jupanga peninsula and a few large islands in the Cerulean sea.  They follow the lead of the city of [[Gunsai]] in matters of foreign relations, but otherwise rule themselves independently.  Each city and its environs is governed by the consensus of its people, although the details vary widely from one city to the next.

= Politics =

Releven politics are complicated, but seldom erupt into full-scale wars between states.  Powerful individuals sometimes assemble private armies to use against each other, but the states rarely choose sides in such conflicts.  There have been periods of all-out war between the cities in the past, and people are not eager to repeat that history.

There is also a multitude of tiny islands in the Cerulean and the Western Sea that have been colonized off and on over the centuries, but they are not considered part of Releven.  Most of them are too poor in arable land to support large populations, but a few have mineable resources.  When wars are fought between powerful families it is usually over mines or quaries in the islands.

= Culture =

The halflings of Releven are fanatic about sports, and many events are held naked (except for the occasional dusting of gold or powdered gem to add color).  Every city holds some kind of major event at least once a season and on any special occasion.  Every three years the Great Games are held in [[Masilia]], where the best atheletes from all of Releven compete for the honor of their cities.

Mounted races are very popular, and the people of Releven are known to saddle anything big enough to carry a halfling.  The most prestigious races are the horse-drawn chariots, which is very fast and highly dangerous.  Those who win in the chariots at the Great Games are traditionally honored by their city with a statue erected in some prominent place.

In combat halflings ride ursine creatures called [[Dus]], of which horses are mortally afraid.  It was the Kretian charioteers in their dus-drawn chariots that stymied [[Mosyph]]'s conquest of Releven for two and a half years.  Champions in the Great Games are eligible to join the [[White Guard]], an elite regiment of the Great Prince of Soubous.
