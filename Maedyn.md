=History=

Maedyn has long been a center of trade for the region.  It is on the west-most spur of the [[Yeron]] river, making it the point on the Yeron which is closest to the [[Stoash]] river in Soubous.  In the early days of the Empire, a great road was built form Soubous crossing the Badlands, down the Gods Stairs, through Maedyn and across the Yeron into Gon-Perod.  [[Mosyph]] turned the city into an administrative center for the region, even though the Asperian throne remained in Oxhed.

During Tygar's reformation (1050's) the throne was moved to Maedyn because Oxhed was too small and inconveniently placed.

==The Center==

The older inner keep of Maedyn has been expanded and strengthened over the years.  It includes the royal palace, barracks, the Justicars, and the Archives.  Most of the important officials of the beauracracy have small living quarters in the Center in addition to their palatial homes outside the city.  Passage through the gates requires a special token or pass.

==The Exchange==

The section of the city where caravans and the river docks meet is the Exchange.  Warehouses, stables, wagon wrights, stevedores, and other transportation-related businesses are clustered here.  When anything is bought or sold in large quantities prior to being moved on to other places, the transaction usually happens here.  In the center of the Exchange is a large square framed by several large buildings.  These include the tax collector's and other regulatory agencies, guildhalls for the various unions, scribes and legal offices.  Much of the ground floor of these buildings is taken up by meeting places.  Obstensibly these are restaurants or purveyors of specialties like tea or wines or spiced coffee, but in reality these are the hotbeds of business.

People looking for passage or freight services can look at the "the board", which is in fact the front of one of the government buildings on which is posted official announcements regarding the time, destination, and point of contact for any large caravan or ship leaving Maedyn.

==Rosebud==

Run by the ever-helpful matron Ledia, the Rosebud has a reputation as excellent boarding at a good price, which not incidentally includes the best breakfast in town.
