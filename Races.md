Here are the dominant races of As-Perod, some brief information about them, and how they differ from the traditional D&D definitions.

[[toc]]

=Humans= 

Humans are the most populous, and are the only race to ever form a true empire.  The shortest-lived of the races, they are in many ways the most varied and interesting.  There are roughly 6m humans in all of As-Perod.  The kingdoms of [[Soubous]] and [[Aspera]] are ruled by human dynasties.
 
=Elves= 

Elves are the longest-lived of all the races (almost 200 years) and because of their slow rate of reproduction only number about twenty thousand.  They live in several nomadic tribes, making a living as laborers and merchants wherever they go.  As strangers nearly everywhere, they are seldom trusted, and sometimes scapegoated.  During at least one period of history, they were mercilessly hunted by the Academy.

Elven culture is insular, with occasional bouts of paranoia.  When elves set up camps most non-elves are only admitted to the "boundary", an area or tents designated for the mingling of elves and "outsiders".  If elves make friends or build relationships with outsiders, it is acceptable for the elf to go and visit the outsider.  Outsiders, other than the necessary authority figures, are rarely allowed inside an elf camp.  Only someone who has performed some notable service to an elven clan is welcomed "inside".  Outsiders who are named friends of a clan are given a token representing their status.  These tokens are often (but not always) recognized among the different clans.

Between their laboring and trading gigs, elves move around carrying their entire civilazations with them.  The tribes move between kingdoms, making seasonal homes in the empty borderlands and wildernesses.  A few elves and half-elves often move ahead of these caravans, negotiating contracts or camping sites.  Caravans are welcomed for the exotic goods, skilled tradesmen, and laborers they bring, but distrust between races is often a problem.

Elves and half-elves share a special bond with nature, and are the only races that produce druids.  Elven healers and herbalists are greatly (if secretly) sought-after, as is the wisdom of the older elves, who are invariably the leaders of their respective tribes.

It is an open secret that the elves have an ancestral homeland somewhere in the badlands, but no outsiders claim to have ever been there.

=Half-Elves= 

Half-Elves are rare and far less numerous than their pure-elf counterparts, totaling about 3 thousand world-wide.  They tend to be comfortable among nearly any race or culture, making them natural diplomats and arcanists.  They live to be about 130, and reproduce on a schedule more like humans than elves.

=Halflings=

Halflings are often thought of as a shorter, heartier variety of human but they think of themselves as a distinct race.  They are proud to the point of  arrogance.  Their society is very martial and caste-driven, and military accomplishment is the only accepted path towards improving one's station.  For a halfling of noble birth the only acceptable occupations are the military or idle retirement.

Halflings relish athletic events, especially feats of endurance.  They are avid racers of anything that can be tamed and ridden.  Ponies, large flightless birds, hippogriffs, elk, and rock-dragons (a kind of large lizard that spits venom) are just some of their favorites.  In combat they ride [[Dus]], a bear-like animal with long legs and thick shaggy fur.  

The halfling nation of [[Releven]] is a confederation of city-states, each with its own proud history.  They accept strangers in their midst, but seldom choose to live among the other races.  With no genuine wars to fight, the cities fight each other in dangerous mock battles, grueling athletics, and bloody arena contests.  In the White Games, a wargame held every five years, warriors compete for the right to join the [[White Guard]], an elite traditional force the bears the crest of the Soubous monarch.

=Dwarves=

Dwarves are a race in desperate decline, numbering only about one hundred thousand.  They are rarely seen outside their mountain home of [[EShyris|E'Shyris]].  They are renowned craftsmen and metalurgists, but the greatest of them never leave their own lands.  To commission a work from the best dwarven craftsmen, one must travel to E'Shyris.  

Young dwarven men are prone to adventuring or apprenticing in foreign places, travel being essential to their education.  In time they return home with the knowledge they have gathered to enrich the craft and lore of their homeland.  

Dwarven women are never seen by outsiders, and this is a matter of great speculation.  Some people claim there are so few women that they are held as national treasures, while others believe the women are completely dominated by their husbands and never allowed out of their homes.  Dwarves do not speak much about their own culture to outsiders, and those few who have spent considerable time within the halls of E'Shyris likewise do not share any such knowledge they may have gained.

=Gnomes=

Gnomes live in close-knit ghettos in the largest cities and and towns throughout As-Perod, and number perhaps three hundred thousand.  Unlike the elves, who are simply nomadic, gnomes are a diaspora.  Their homeland is on a far-away continent to the north, which was invaded by the Emperor [[Sidir]] during his quest for diefication.  Soon after the imperial army defeated the gnomes' capital city of [[Cross Maschaket]] the veil appeared and drove everyone, gnome and imperial alike, off of the continent.  

When the gnomes arrived on the Empire's shores they were refused any land of their own to settle, so they split their surviving population among the major cities of the day.  Many fell into slavery, and many of their decendants remain slaves to this day.  Their small stature and clever minds make them poor laborers, so they are often used as house slaves, tutors, and skilled labor.

Learning among gnomes is highly valued, and they often aspire to work as healers, tutors, sages, and arcanists.  A gnome is more likely to choose the Academy as his profession than any other race and no less than three of the Council's seats are held by gnomes.

Everything essential about Gnomish history, culture, religion, and wisdom is contained in the [[Maschaket Canon]], a selection of about a dozen books often bound together in a few volumes.

=Lizardfolk=

Lizardfolk are native to the swamps of [[Ild-Eldir]], formed by the mouth of the river [[Yeron]], and rarely wander far from it.  The lizardfolk took over the region after the Years of Flood and Famine destroyed the human civilization that used to thrive there.  The navigable channels through the swampland are few, and those who control the shipping lanes have the power to toll the boats that must pass through the region.  Consequently, most tribal lizardfolk fighting is over control of those few shipping lanes.

Off-shore is about 20 miles of coastline that fell into the ocean in the Years of Flood and Famine (989-991).  Several cities and other important sites are deep under water there including the former human capital of [[Saunders]], the palace of [[Chetwode]], and the temple to the ocean goddess [[Euphrasia]].
