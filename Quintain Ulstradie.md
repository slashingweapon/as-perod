= Quintain Ulstradie =

Quintain was a trusted slave in the Arducian household of Lord Marshal Yousef.  Though legally he was only property, Quintain was steward of his master's house.  Among the huge changes at the end of the [[Righteous War]] was the death of his master Yousef and the collapse of the household.  Spurred on by the words of divine revelation as preached by Earkey Timbers, Quintain escaped Soubous with much of the family fourtune.  He went in Sanmina to join the expedition, donating not only the Djaref family fortune by his own considerable skills.
