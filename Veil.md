title: The Veil
---

The Veil is the protective barrier that separates As-Perod from everywhere else.  It's origins are not recent, but neither are they lost to the mists of antiquity.

== History ==

The emperor [Sidir](Sidir.html), gransdon of the fabled [Mosyph](Mosyph.html), extended his empire's reach well beyond the eastern and northern coasts of As-Perod while at the same time tightening his grip on the people already under his dominion.  He was a [divergent](divergent.html), and with the vast resources available to him was able to achieve a level of magical power that was unprecedented.  In his final years he insisted on being worshiped as a god, and many believed he would indeed achieve deification.

In the year 220 C.E. a major change came over the conquered lands.  Mists began to gather in the farthest reaches of the empire, mists which men were afraid to enter.  This barrier slowly rolled towards the heart of As-Perod, driving all of the Third Children before it.  Soldiers left their posts, settlers abandoned their towns, and people fought for scarce transport seats back to their homeland.  Within a few months the  mysterious barrier had halted its advance several miles off the shores of As-Perod and the Third Children were coraled into thier native land.

== Effects ==

Attempts to pierce the barrier, either by magic or by force, invariably fail.  Men who try to walk or sail through the mist suddenly find themselves traveling away from it without any recollection of turning around.  Whole armies, such as the one Sidir tried to march into Gon-Perod, have disappeared into the Veil only to reappear hours later scattered and confused.  There are apocryphal stories of people who enter the Veil and never return, or who claim to have spent days or weeks beyond the Veil, but these are unsubstantiated at best.
  
The barrier is not merely physical in nature; it also creates less tangible boundaries.  The gods, once so active in the daily lives of the Third Children, fell silent and their priests could no longer perform miracles for the faithful.  The magical means of transportation that helped to make the empire so wealthy were suddenly unusable.  Outsiders could no longer be called to aid the Emperor's armies.  Shockingly, the dead needed special rites to guide them into the afterlife or else their spirits would linger.

Most striking of all is the Veil's effect on people.  Sidir did not achieve his ascention, and in fact lost many of his abilities.  Much of the Academy's power was attenuated.  The most extraordinary heroes seemed to lose some of their skill.  The more extreme forms of magic suddenly became unusable.  In short, all fields of humanoid endeavor were suddenly and inexplicably restricted.

Even after the effects of the Veil settled in it seemed As-Perod would remain a populous and vibrant land.  But the long centuries since then have seen a slow decline in all the races and all the pursuits of her people.  Much was done in the old times that can not be replicated now; much magic is lost; many cities cannot be rebuilt; nations have shrunk; knowldge has been lost.  And still, the gods do not speak to men.  

== Origins ==

There are two main theories about the origins and purpose of the Veil.  The first is that it was created by the gods to punish Sidir for his pride.  The gods, or so the thinking goes, do no wish a repeat of Sidir's reckless ambition which caused so much terror and grief.

The second is that the Veil was made by a person or persons unknown, to shut off the heavens from Sidir's reach.  The leading contenders for the mortal-made Veil theory are the Academy and the Fey who live in Gon-Perod.  The long-term effects are perhaps unintended, but that too is debated.

I will mention one other theory as well, though it is not likely.  That is that Sidir created the Veil himself, as either a weapon or a defensive boundary, inadvertently was the cause of his own demise.  Although poetic, this theory has little evidence to support it.
