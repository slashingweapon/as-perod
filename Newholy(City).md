= Overview =

Newholy used to be a much more crowded area, but declining birth rates and the rise of [[Reeland]] as a trade center has emptied much of this once-industrial city.  In recent years the abandoned buildings have been torn down and the stones used to increase the fortifications.  The newly leveled areas have been turned into parks, arboretums of exotic plans and animals, monuments, and grand homes.  [[perod-secrets:Jamyt|Prince Jamyt]] has been behind many of these renovations.

Newholy has spent enormous amounts of money building a series of colliseums and sporting arenas.  The grandest autumn festival in the kingdom is hosted here, and anyone with the time and money journeys to Newholy to enjoy the spectacle or in hopes of winning one of the extravagant prizes.  The celebration begins on the fall equinox and ends one month later in a 3-day bacchinal.  During this time the population of the city more than quadruples (in a good year), with many year-round residents chosing to rent out their homes at extravagant rates and live in the country for the duration.  In the year 1141, the planned games are said to be of special magnificence.

= Geography =

The city is built on a series of low, wide hills on the banks of the Mersey river where it leaves the Angsul forest.  The city is a classic three-layered town.  

The inner keep is much as it has been for the last thousand years, a 100' high sheer-walled tower on the crest of a flat-topped hill.  The tower is surrounded by a large space of mostly empty ground surrounded by the inner wall. The barracks, military stables, training ground, etc. are located along the edges of this space.  Common folk are allowed onto the inner wall during certain hours of the day to watch the military practice.  Commoners also work in the barracks area during the day.  The middle wall is 40' thick and stands at the military crest of the hill, and gains extra height at the outside (60') thanks to its positioning.  It is riddled with murderholes, battlements, and the usual assortment of other fortifications.


The space between the inner wall and the middle wall is called the "inner city" or "old city" by most of the inhabitants.  It spreads out from the inner wall in a southeast direction towards the Mersey river.  It is a crowded area filled with the workshops and homes of the numerous people who service the wealthy and noble classes who make up the majority of the outer city.  There is a large market area and a few wide streets that connect the gates of the middle and inner walls, and another wide street around the inner wall.  The shops and houses around these well-traveled areas are middle-class homes and businesses.  Wander more than a couple of blocks from these avenues and you find yourself in the "between areas": tightly-packed working-class homes and shops, and poor families who work in menial jobs, usually for wealthy or middle-class families.  The middle wall is 30' high and 15' wide, with a tower near each of the four gates.

The outter wall and the "outer city" that it encloses mostly stretches to the northwest, upriver from the inner city.  Large areas of the outer city are given over to palatial homes for the wealthy, especially along the famed Fountain Boulevard, and various monuments, stadiums, theaters, parks, and other centers for public entertainment.  There is also a large number of luxury shops and taverns for the wealthy and well-to-do.  The people who work in these homes and establishments either live on the premises (a coveted situation) or commute from the inner city or one of the several towns outside the city walls.  

All of this wealth does not apply to the south-west portion of the outer city, the river quarter, where are found the river docks and warehouses for the enormous quantity of food and goods consumed by the city.  Most goods entering the city come through one of the south or southwest facing gates of the city or from the river gate, while most other traffic enters where Newholy shows its best face: the eastern and northern gates.  The few industries located within the city are also in the river quarter.  The outter wall is recent, and more of a social border than a military fortification.  It is only ten feet high and eight feet wide on average, with guard posts at each gate entrance.

Outside the city walls is empty grassland at least a quarter-mile in every direction (for catapult fire), and beyond that is several smaller towns.

= Locations =

== Outer City ==

=== The Damask Prince ===

The Prince is the theater for the wealthy.  It is an opulent building that seats over 500 people.  It features plays and music year-round except in winter.  The cost of entry is 1-2g for floor seats and 5g for raised first-floor box seats.  Upper-floor box seats are not for sale, but are auctioned off every three years to the highest bidders.  There is a thriving unofficial trade in upper box seats, and their owners get 10-20g per seat.

=== Thresher's Well ===

In the middle of a neighborhood near the south gate is a thick copper pipe that emerges out of the street to a height of four feet, then curves down about a half a foot.  Near the spout is a trough for watering horses.  Carved on the flagstones in large letters at the foot of the pipe is the following inscription.

> //Water//
> "No man is long thirsty who can bring 
> about good things by his own hands.
> All men are noble who draw water for 
> those too weak to drawn their own.

Attached to the pipe itself is a bronze plaque.

> This well was made by the residents of Thresher Street 
> and completed on the First Day of Summer, 1101.  We 
> thank the following for their special aid and inspiration.
> **Father Danburr** of Oxhed
> **Jaq**, Thane of Reeland
> **Larshi**, of Ild-An
> **Issyren** the Arcanist
> **Ferrule Lighthammer**

When anyone near the pipe speaks the word "water", clean cold water gushes out of the pipe until the person tells it to stop.

== Inner City ==

=== Copper Maiden ===

The Maiden is conveniently located one block from the north gate just inside the inner city.  Rising tastes have forced the proprietor to put cloths on the tables, provide clean cups, paint the walls, and equip his establishment with various other indulgences that the aspiring middle-class is prone to want.  There are drinks and sometimes music in the front, gambling in the back, and private rooms upstairs for travelers.  

The owner, Quick Charlie, is a dwarf who bemoans the loss of the good old days when plentiful beer and paid sex were enough to make a tavern.  Twenty years ago it was a simple wooden one-story structure that served drinks in wooden bowls, had one dice table, and the rooms were used almost exclusively for sex.  

The tavern is one of three buildings on this block, all of them adjoining.  Charlie owns all three, but only the Maiden has any veneer of respectability.  Drugs, most kinds of sex, and commerce in "unconventional wares" can be arranged with astonishing efficiency in the other establishments.  Most of the patrons of the less savory businesses enter through the alleyway in back.

It is well-known that Quick Charlie is a contact for the thieves guild.  People who make trouble in the Copper Maiden or elsewhere in "Charlie's Row" often have a sudden turn of bad luck.

=== Swaying Woods ===

This is a modest but comfortable inn favored by military officers for its soft beds and reasonable price of only one gold per day.  Two additional silver gets you stabling for a horse two doors down the way.  The proprietess has a good safe for valuables, cooks decently, and has a small staff for cleaning and running errands.  The house is conveniently located across the street from the inner gate.  

The owner is the widow Mary Gateswold, whose husband Bronteias Gateswold was a rider.  He died some years back during one of the many skirmishes with goblins in the Silver Hills.  She turned their large home into an boarding house to support herself and pay for her two sons' equipment and education to be Riders like their father.  Her sons Remmy and Mel are mounted archers in the Duke's army.

=== Wilavon's Variety Theater ===

Wilavon runs what could best be described as a vaudville show for the masses.  Between his team of regular talent and the traveling actors that he lets to, he can produce a different show every two weeks.  Comedy, acrobatics, popular myths, well-known sing-alongs, and the occasional political carriacature make up his show.  3c gets you on the ground floor, and 2s gets you a seat at a booth.  1g allows you to rent an entire booth for yourself and your guests.  The theater packs 300 people on a good night.
