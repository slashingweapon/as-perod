title: Wardcrafting
---



Wardcrafting is a skill unique to As-Perod.  Wards are special symbols that invoke magic effects.  The exact origin of these symbols isn't known, but the earliest recorded practice of wardcrafing is towards the end of the reign of the emperor Sidir.

= Craft (Ward) =

Creating wards correctly is a technical skill, and the more skillfully it is done then the better the results.  Each warding consists of a primary symbol that determines the effect, plus additional symbols that specify how the effect is applied.  There are symbols for creature types and subtypes, a phonetic alphabet for names, numbers, etc..  All told it is a relatively small symbology with diverse applications.

== Materials ==

Wards consume their mediums, which means they eventually have to be redrawn.  Wards that are constantly active consume their materials slowly over time, while those that activate on use consume large amounts of material suddenly.

Any continuous ward that consumes less than 1sp of resources per day can be drawn in chalk or charcoal or other simple medium and last for 10 hours before the medium is consumed.  More costly wards are carved into surface and filled periodically with a paste containing a powdered, crystaline gem.

== Time ==

The number of minutes it takes to draw a ward is the warder's skill check divided by 10.  If he takes ten, the number of minutes equals the skill check.

This is only the time required to draw the wards.  If the warder wants to carve it out to accept warding paste he'll need to make an appropriate craft check (woodworking, metalworking, etc..)  If the warder wants to draw a temporary ward that has a value greater than 1sp he can buy "warding sticks" which are like grease pencils with powdered gemstones mixed in.

== Form and Medium ==

There are three ways to create wards: drawn, engraved, and molded. 

Simple, cheap, short-lived wards can be drawn on reasonably flat surface using chalk or "warding paste" in which powdered gems have been added to power the magic of the wards.  As the ward provides its protection the materials are used up until none of the drawing medium  remains.

Wards can also be carved into a surface.  This allows valuable paste to be applied in the grooves of the ward each day to extend the life of the ward.  After the wardcrafter has drawn the symbols a craftsman with the appropriate skill (stoneworking, woodworking, etc) must make skill check at the same DC as the ward to carve it into the stone.  Once this is done the ward can be activated by simply using it.

Wards of protection and absorption protect usually protect people, so they must be carried around by the warded creature.  The usual procedure is for the wardcrafter to draw out the ward on a block of metal or stone, from which another craftsperson will make a mold or stamp.  At the less expensive end, globs of gold are stamped into medallions worth up to 50gp.  At the opposite end of the spectrum, gold or platinum is poured into molds to produce elaborate amultes, sometimes embellished with gems.  The cost of a medallion is usually 20% higher than the materials that it is made of (and hence the value it provides) because of the overhead involved.

These molds are considered quite valuable property and are heavily protected.  They wear down quickly with repeated use, and every twenty stamping/moldings reduces the DC of the ward by 1.

== Names ==

A warder can use truenames (see *Tome of Magic*) to restrict the purpose of the warded area to a specific creature.  Such a creature makes his saves against the effect of the ward at -4.  Other creatures are unaffected by the ward.

== Standard Wards ==

A standard book of wards costs 100g, runs 100 pages, and includes the following wards, their variations, and instructions for correct inscription.  Such a book is essential, and without it a crafter can not take 10 when drawing wards.

|| **Effect** || **DC** || **Save DC** || **Cost** ||
|| Bless || 12 || N/A || 1cp / day ||
|| Alarm || 15 || N/A || 1cp / hour ||
|| Forbid Creature || 18 || check / 2 || 2cp / day ||
|| Harden || 25 || N/A || 1sp / day / 10-foot-cube ||
|| Protect || 30 || 10 + (check/3) || 5g / attacker HD / use ||
|| Absorb Damage || 30 || N/A || 1g / HP ||
|| Key || 15+ || N/A || N/A ||
|| Require Key || 15+ || N/A || N/A ||

=== Bless ===

The Ward of Blessing prevents dead bodies in the area from accumulating negative energy and rising as undead.  It protects an area 20' square.

=== Alarm ===

The alarm ward detects the presence of the indicated type of creature and sounds an audible alarm if that creature is present.  It can affect a portal (see Forbid Creature) or a 40' radius from center of the symbol.

=== Forbid Creature ===

The Ward of Forbiddance prevents creatures of a specific type (undead, humanoid, etc) from passing through the warded plane.  Any creature that tries and fails its saving throw is pushed back five feet.  The save DC is 1/2 of the warder's skill check.  Mindless creatures such as zombies do not receive a saving throw.

A single inscription can protect a 10x10 plane.  The protected plane must be bounded on at least two opposite sides by stationary markers (doorjamb, post, etc.), both of which receive portions of the inscription over their entire length.  The symbols must face inwards, towards each other.  The most common use for this ward is to protect homes from undead or wild animals.

=== Harden ===

This ward hardens an object against damage, increasing its hardness by 1/6th of the crafter's Wardcraft check.

=== Protect ===

Protect performs much the same purpose as forbid, except that is protects a person instead of a space.  The ward is typcially crafted as a mold, which is then used to cast amulets using a gold or other precious metal, often alloyed with another metal for strength.  The protection ward prevents a designated creature type from physically touching or melee-attacking the bearer of the ward.  This protection extends to the ehtereal plane, protecting against incorporeal creatures.

When the target creature succeeds on an attack roll against a warded creature, he makes a will save against the save DC of the ward.  If he succeeds then he bypasses the ward.  However, if he fails then his attack stops just short.

Thwarting an attack consumes 5gp per hit dice if the attacker.  If the ward doesn't have enough value remaining then it is consumed utterly in its attempt to protect the bearer, and the resulting blowback deals 1d6  damage to the bearer.  The bearer must make a reflex save DC 15 or be stunned for one round.

It is worth remembering here that there are only 50gp in one pound of gold.  Particularly valuable amultes will be made of platinum and studded with gems when they are new.  Otherwise they would be far too heavy.

The maximum worth of such a ward is the warder's check * 5.

=== Absorb ===

Absorption wards will absorb half of any kind of energy-based damage (fire, cold, acid, sonic, water) that would normally be suffered by the character.  The ward is usually cast into amulets, like protection wards.  The cost per activation is 1gp per hit point of damage absorbed.  

=== Key ===

Keys are arbitrary symbols defined by those who create them, used to identify their bearers thus allowing them to pass through certain wards unhindered.  The DC of a key is a minimum of 15, but can be as high as the designer wants it to be.

Keys can be in any form, from written on paper to carved in stone or cast in metal or made of twisted wire just to name a few possibilities.  Keys that need to be kept secret even from their bearers are often created in a negative space, cast into an otherwise solid object by a lost-wax or similar method.

Keys are intentionally complex, and creating one from memory is only possibly if the crafter has made that key before and is very familiar with it.  Still, the crafter can not take ten unless he has an authoritative model to work from (same as normal wards).  Keys can be forged by people who have had time to closely examine one, but incurs a -5 penalty on the craft check.

== Require Key ==

Alarm and Protection wards can be further augmented to require keys for passage.  Anyone bearing the correct symbol on his person does not trigger the ward.  There is no additional cost to add a key to a ward, but it does take time: one minute to do it quickly, or ten minutes to take ten.

The DC to add a key to a ward is the same as to create the key itself.
