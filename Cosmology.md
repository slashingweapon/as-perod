= The Universe According to the Academy =

The Academy teaches that the [[Veil]] was created by early magicians to regulate the flow of magic and protect As-Perod from the chaos that exists ouside its borders both physical and dimentional.  Threats lurk constantly outside the limits of the veil, and the Academy is vigilant in keeping them at bay.

The Academy eschews the idea of gods creating the multiverse as an organized collection of planes.  All that lies outside the prime material plane is chaos, filled with demons.  Instead, it teaches the concept of spontaneous organization.  If there is a diety, he is an absent and nameless one.  

Outside the Academy people are more prone to believe in gods.

= Creation Myths =

Every culture in As-Perod has its own creation myth.  Most of these myths are true, representing one view of events that are mortally incomprehensible.  The gods accept these various myths, even originate them, as different paths to mortal understanding of the divine.

The nomadic elven tribes believe in the Great Craftsman who fashioned the inner planes and elder gods from the chaos out of the primordial na-verse using song and finely wrought metals.  He goes on to create the outer planes to give the gods a special place to live.  Each step along the way he imbues his creations with part of his own spirit in order to bring them into existence.  The elder gods created yet other gods, who then create Gon-Perod, As-Perod, and many other worlds and the beings that populate them.  After the creation of all the planes and the elder gods, the Great Craftsman became tired and fell asleep.  He will awake when the meta-verse is destroyed, releasing his spirit that is trapped within.  He might then perform some new creation.

The primitive humans of the far West are anamists.  They believe that the Oldest Spirit made the sky-father and the earth-mother.  These two create the other gods who then create animals, people, and so on.  The mother and father, their energies spent, retire to the sky and to the deep earth to sleep.  The sun is the sleeping sky-father, turning in his sleep.  The ocean waves are caused by the Earth-Mother's slumbering breath.

The most significant comonalities of creation myths is that the physical world was not created all at once.  First, the elder gods and the planes were created.  Then the elder gods created the younger gods.  Then the younger gods created the earth and sky, the plants and animals and dragons (the First Children).  Unsatisfied they then created the fey (the Second Children).  Some time later they created the Third Children (dwarves, humans, elves, etc.).

Some of the other common themes among all these myths are:

* divine forces invest part of themselves to create worlds and races
* the younger gods' powers are enhanced by the belief and worship of the mortal races
* the existence of old gods, either dead or slumbering, who perhaps are waiting to return when some preconditions are met

= The Pantheon Of As-Perod =

The pantheon of As-Perod is very loose, and is based on the standard D&D panteon.  Greater deities have accumulated enough power to exist independently of their worshipers or creations and usually become disinterested in mortal affairs to the point of becoming nameless.  Younger deities (those of the D&D pantheon) stand to accumulate power when their creations fourish and worship them, thus they take a greater interest in mortal affairs.  

Animist cultures find and cultivate relationships with the divine power within places or things on the material plane.  The worship and recognition of the followers enhance and define the personality of that power.  Animist cultures recognize the existence of the "outer gods", but concern themselves mainly with the world around them as a practical matter.

The fey, who were the Second Children of creation and reside in Gon-Perod, recognize the gods but do not worship them.  The more powerful fey are old and god-like in their own right, although their powers do not extend far beyond their own realm.  The denizens of a powerful fey's domain are loyal bordering on worshipful, which is part of what gives these beings their power.  Gon-Perod contains many such domains, quite a few of them nesting or overlapping.  Not all of them are good, and quite a few are hostile towards the Third Children.  The fey sometimes venture into As-Perod out of curiosity (those who are not strictly tied to a specific location).

Dragons, dire animals, and some forms of plant life are all that is left of the first children.  It is rumored that some races of dire animals can still speak, although their children do not have that power.  Dragons are intimately tied to the earth itself, and never die of old age.  Instead, they enter a long sleep during which they merge with the earth.  Some mountain spirits venerated by animists are dragons whose bodies have long since become part of the hills they once inhabited.

= The Role Of The Divine In Everyday Life =

Divine presence is the source of all power and growth.  Conversely, growth is an expression of the divine.  Wherever life or power flourish, the multiverse expands.  Belief is the demi-urge of creation.  To create is to invest a part of oneself in the created. 

The gods create because it is in their nature to do so, and because worshipful followers increase a god's power and standing.  There was a time when the gods involved themselves intimately in mortal affairs, and when they gave a great deal of power to their priests and followers.  Those days have gone.

== Death Rites ==

When the spirits of the dead are not properly conducted into the afterlife, they haunt the living.  Not only is it disconcerting to face the ghost of your recently-deceased loved ones, but these spirits can turn bad, posses people or animals, and resent the living.  Therefore death rites are of key importance to every culture.  

Gnomes spread out grain or bread for sparrows, who arrive in astounding numbers and then carry the deceased spirit away.  Elves tied their dead into biers which the raise high into the tallest trees.  The corpses are visited by the night-lark, which plucks the soul from corpses' mouths and carry them into the night sky.  Halflings burn their dead on pyres of a size that match the deceased's rank.  Half-elves follow the customs of whichever culture they have adopted as their own.  The death practices of the dwarves are a secret, but on the rare occasions they die away from home their bodies are packed in salt or alcohol and carried home.

Humans, being the most numerous and widespread of all the third children, have the most varied practies.  In [[Soubous]] the dead are interred in the many underground crypts which, it is said, are connected to the Well of Souls through the many underground passages upon which the ancient city is built.  On the night of the new moon the spirits are drawn out of the crypts and into the well, though noone living knows the path thaken.

In the far west the savage humans wind their dead in sheets then place them at the edge of the ocean.  As night falls they beat drums to summon Kidesiku, a creature that lives deep in the sea.  Near midnight huge black tentacles reach out to shore and accept the bodies, dragging them down to the great Sea-Mother, whom the beast serves.

= The Divine Veil =

In the past the gods became angry with their children and turned their faces away from As-Perod.  The event was sudden and fairly recent, although outside of any living memory.  The races of men, cut off from the full favor of their gods, are unable to replicate the achievements of their ancestors.  There exists much lore that modern men are unable to fully grasp, much magic they can no longer use, and great works that can not be remade.

Explanations for this separation vary from one culture to the next.  The most accepted view is that the Golden Emperor's bid for deification so offended the gods that they chose to withhold their full favor from the third children.  As-Perod was almost destroyed, and the gods will not allow that to happen again.
