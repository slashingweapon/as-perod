title: Stamhead
---

 The mountain of Stamhead is over 4400 feet high, the tallest in the region.  The summit is covered in snow nearly all year long, and runoff from the mountain feeds moors to the north.   Below the mountain is a valley, which receives the yearly runoff from it and the nearby hills.  Thousands of years of cultivation have left it fertile enough to support a small town.  The people there grow mostly root vegetables and hardy grains.  During the summers they forage on the moors for sweet berries -- a delicacy.  They hunt the moors for birds and grazing animals all year long.

The town is currently named Stamfield, though it has had other names over the millennia.  It has been almost continuously occupied for over three thousand years.  The centerpiece of the town is the church, a grand edifice compared to the small town around it.  The construction dates to many different eras, but the oldest part of the nave dates back to before the era of King Sammit.  The temple is surmounted by a large white dome, and is dedicated to Heironeous and Hextor.  

At the first tactical rise is the seat of the Laird, called Whiterose Hall.  It is an oblong fortress with a keep on one end and two towers at the other flanking an iron-bound gate.   From the keep’s lookout you can see the entire valley and town below, and the road which approaches the fortress.  

A few hundred yards  from Whiterose is Stamhead Lake, which is about 1/2 mile long and only 700 feet at its widest point.  Above the lake rises the rest of the mountain, a rocky dome that climbs 2000 feet into the air.  The approach from the lake summit is the easiest, but the left-hand side is a cliff for almost the full 2000 feet.  A stone path, in poor repair, climbs the summit in long serpentines from the lake-facing side.

Stamfield today is run by hereditary kings, though they are still called Lairds.  They are advised by a council of elected townsfolk, who in theory have the ability to depose the Laird.  Such a course of action has not be taken since the ninth century when Laird Hathalder was deemed too weak to defend the town against marauding goblins and was replaced by Laird Maeriss.  It is Maeriss’ decendant Laird Kelowind  who is now Laird.
