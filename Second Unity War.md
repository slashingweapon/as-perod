# The Second Unity War (1146-????)

Unlike the Unity Wars of the fourth century, which was fought to prevent a break-up of the Imperium, the Second Unity War was begun to establish a new Empire, under the reign of the Grand Prince Djazeef, and was heavily backed by the Arcane Academy.

Ostensibly, the war is being fought to bring two demonically influenced regimes into the enlightenment of the Principalities of Soubous, thus ending an imminent threat to the safety and security of the Principalities. However, this danger has been vastly over-estimated, if indeed it exists at all. Rather, it is the ambition of the Grand Prince to establish an Imperial legacy, coupled with the Academy's philosophical differences with the religiously-founded nations of Dwarves, Elves, and the Far East. These conflicts are also being fed by certain economic and climatic forces.
