## Session 4

The group's mission is to recon-by-fire southern bank of the Brenwhite River, near the fort currently populated by humans.  It is 100 miles from the Bay of Tears.


## Session 3

After much discussion, catch the baby owlbears and pen them in.  Someone will come and get them later.

On the way home, someone tries to pick Ranjoon's pocket and AT88 tries to kill him for it.  After a severe but partially-subdual and totally unfair beatdown, the party has themselves a satyr named [Fenast](Fenast.html).  Lana questions him and AT88 shakes him until he poops goat pellets.  He swears he was just curious and wasn't going to keep Ranjoon's purse.  When given the purse to look at, he seems disappointed that it contains only money.  Also, his powers of "detect stick" work well enough to recognize that Drake is a stuffed shirt.  After lots of going round and round, everyone agrees not to kill Fenast if he'll hang out with them until sundown.  He claims the hospitality of the party.

There's a lot of music, and dice, and stories.  The party learns a few things:
* Satyr's really are decent musicians.  And they dance, too.
* Fey silver pieces come in all kinds of shapes.  Gnome money is "boring".
* Fenast's loyalties are to someone called the Lady of the Silver Vale, but he won't say where or how far away this vale is or how many people there are at the Fey settlement.  He sings songs of her ancient beauty.
* To the south are tall hills and giants.  Some are "okay", but others are mean and stupid
* Cross Maschaket is far, far, far up the east river.  Fenast says he hears that there's a dragon living there now, with goblin and giant servants who pay homage with virgin blood (which is rare, on account of all the satyrs).
* To get to Cross Maschaket by river, you have to pass through the [Red Canyon](Red Canyon.html).  Ogres live there, but they might let people pass for tribute (virgin blood is suggested)
* The big owlbear's name was Old Grumpy.  Fenast teaches Lana a song about all the things Old Grumpy ate.
* Fenast warns the party about a troll that lives in the area -- about the only thing in the area that Old Grumpy didn't eat.


The party shows him their city, and Fenast is amazed.  (Hey, it's been a thousand years!)  Fenast promises to tell the Lady about the return of the gnomes, and that there will be an envoy waiting at Seanote.  For parting gifts, he trades a thorned ring for Piffle's "fart-box".  He trades kisses with Lana, does a little dance and takes off into the woods.

## Session 2

The party returns to the Bay of Tears and report their findings to Quintain.  Soon after, there is a meeting with all of the available mappers where he updates people on general developments, and hands out assignments.  Bullet points:

* The camp is getting restless.  Most people in the camp are eager to move up the East River towards [Cross Maschaket](Cross Maschaket.html), and it is getting difficult to hold them back until proper scouting can be done.
* Some people are finding high ground on which to build permanent structures.  Quintain is worried that with people spreading out, they're more likely to encounter trouble.
* About four days up the East River, some humans have built a fort.  Teams have been dispatched to investigate.
* A gnome child named Tariel Aikin found some engraved stones to the south.

The party is dispatched to contact Tariel's family and investigate the area around the engraved stones.

The party goes and does that, and with a lot of searching discovers the ruins of Seanote, an ancient gnomish artist colony that used to be on the north side of the Bay of Tears.  (But now it is apparently on the south side of the bay.)  The extensive burrow complex was famous as the home of the Silverstrings bard's guild, whose last master Alrin Anon wrote a song called *People's Lament* which is recorded in The Book.

The burrows are covered in a couple feet of silt and other refuse.  There are signs of owlbears around.  Burried in the silt, the party discovers a construct made of adamantine, designated **AT88**.  He is only 15% functional.  In the great hall, the party also discovers a pit filled with 100 gnomish zombies (left there by Sidir's conquering forces 1000 years ago).  The wizard sets fire to the pit.

Then the owlbears show up: first some little ones, and then a great big daddy owlbear.  The party smartly retreats into a narrow hallway where the huge owlbear can't reach them, and they kill it mostly from a distance.  

Searching the ruins, the party finds:

==Session 1== 

The party gets marching orders from their boss, [Quintain Ulstradie](Quintain Ulstradie.html) of the Mapping and Scouting Service. He tells them to requisition a river boat and explore up the North River. They are to look for signs of life, and the lost colony of Grand Plateau (Direburn commanding). The party goes. Over the next several days they spot some form of massive river creatures (which they don't investigate too closely) and they find the ruins of Grand Plateau. It is abandoned. Apparently they were attacked by harpies, but only a few bodies are left behind. There is no sign of anyone else. A search of the mayor's house reveals a wooden box with a burning hands trap, and some uncut emeralds from inside one of the skeletons.

The party gets lured by harpysong to a big treehouse a mile or so distant from the town. Drake falls into a pit, and the other party members break their trance and fight the harpies. The party wins. They account for eight more missing people, but that still leaves the better part of a hundred gnomes unaccounted for. During the fighting, the treehouse is set on fire. After it finishes burning, the party ransacks ruins for treasure and clues.
