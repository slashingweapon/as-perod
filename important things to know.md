There are a few unusual aspects of As-Perod that bear highlighting.

== General ==

Character advancement does not exceed 10th level.  There is some disagreement on just why this is so.  Some say it is because of the [[Veil]], while others say it is because the gods no longer walk in the land, while others say people today just aren't as talented as in ages past.

Liftimes are limited to about 150 years, even for the longest-lived races.  While some people, elves especially, insist that people used to live far longer, the [[Arcane Academy]] dismisses it as folklore.  

Nobody has been beyond the mists of the [[Veil]], which surrounds all of As-Perod, since it appeared several hundred years ago.  Those who try suddenly find themselves turned around.

Divine magic is exceedingly rare.  In most parts of As-Perod it is wholly unknown, and most people refuse to believe in the Gods.  In the few places where divine magic is found the Academy avoids interferring with those who wield it, mainly because clerics have the protection of their powerful churches and local authorities.  Nonetheless, Arcanists view the odd divine caster with a jaundiced eye.

== Death ==

Sentient creatures that die must be given their appropriate death rites on or before the night of the dark moon (new moon).  If their souls are not ushered into the afterlife before then, they rise as undead.  There's only one thing as traumatic as having to bury Mom, and that's to have her come knocking at your door a few nights later because she wants to devour your living flesh.  Well, there's one thing even worse than that: having to chop her up and burn her decayed-but-still-moving parts in the family fireplace to keep them from re-assembling.

Arcanists explain this in the following way.  Death rituals are a weak and primitive form of arcane magic that infuses the corpse with a slight amount of positive energy.  Without these rituals currents of negative energy occasionally might find the body and collect in it.  The night of the new moon is the time of month with the least amount of positive energy, and that is the night that corpses infused with negative energy might rise.  All of this is very rare, they say.

A few crackpots insist this behavior of corpses is proof of a spiritual world and of gods, but hardly anyone educated listens to them.

== Magic ==

Planar travel is highly restricted.  Protecting the Prime Material plane from incursion is one of the functions of the [[Veil]], and Arcanists say this is a good thing because there is only chaos outside the Prime Material plane.  

This has certain side-effect on magic, and on the usual flow of energies between all of the inner planes.

=== Inner Planes ===

The Prime Material, Ethereal, and Shadow planes mostly work as expected because they are coexistent.  However, it is difficult to physically travel between the planes for any length of time.  Each round an entity native to the Prime Material spends in the Ethreal or Shadow planes they must make a Will save (DC15) or be forced back into the Prime Material plane. The reverse is also true.

Spells like //blink//, which temporarily move a person between the PM and Ethereal planes, work normally.  //Secret Chest// also works normally because it moves an object and not a person.  //Shadow Walk// and //Ethereal Jaunt// would fail after a short time because of the per-round saving throws characters would have to make to keep from being ejected back to the Prime Material.

Some magic that uses shadow energies operate at reduced effectiveness.  (See summary.)

=== Outer Planes ===

Spells of the school "Conjuration (Calling)" will fail because they require travel through the Astral plane.  This includes //Planar Ally// and //Planar Binding//.

Spells of the school "Conjuration (Summoning)" will usually fail, although they occasionally work under the right conditions.    //Summon Monster// will almost always fail because it summons an outsider.  //Summon Nature's Ally// works because it summons a creature from the Prime Material plane.

Don't let anyone from the Academy know that you summoned any kind of outsider, or they will put you in the Academy's jail for tampering with the dimensional integrity of the universe.

Conjuration (Teleportation) spells do not work because they require the traveler to enter the Astral plane.  This includes //Dimension Door//, //Plane Shift//, //Teleport//, //Teleport Object//, and //Word of Recall//.

//Tree Stride// is a little different because it allows a druid to merge with a tree.  The druid can not teleport between trees, but can still merge with a tree for the duration of the spell.

Direct communication with a diety as with //Commune// does not work.  (Arcanists say this is because dieties do not exist.)  

=== Dismissal ===

Any creature not native to the Prime Material may be more easily dismissed or banished than normal.  //Dismissal// and //Banishment// spells have a +5 DC modifier.

=== Turning/Rebuking Undead ===

Turning checks and turning damage are at +4.


=== Non/Extra-Dimensional Spaces ===

Bags of Holding, Portable Holes, and spells like //Rope Trick// or //Mage's Magnificent Mansion// work because they use extradimentional spaces that do not connect to any other planes. 

Great care must be taken, however.  A wizard once tried to bend the rules to create an astral portal by inserting a portable hole into a bag of holding.  Not only did he lose his two magical items and their contents, but everything within 100 yards was sucked into the Astral Plane never to return, leaving behind a large crater.
