Magi Gammon was a fifth-century elven Arcanist.  After his apprenticeship he spent the next decade or so studying antiquities and architecture.  Gregarious, intelligent, and clever, his familiar was a rook (relative to crows).  While still young he adopted the rook as his symbol and never parted with it.  Even while living under various aliases, he would include rooks into his work, often cryptographically.

The Academy at the time was attempting to re-establish its power in the wake of the total collapse of the Empire, and the repudiation of divine magic was a centerpiece of the new dogma.  Gammon’s study of divine lore and the open publication of his findings branded him a heretic, and he was forced into hiding.  Unlike many of his peers on the run, he was very good at not being found.  Once he disappeared the Academy never got near him again.  But they certainly heard from him.  A number of Academy Enforcers who were on his trail fell prey to elaborate ruses and traps.

Over the years Gammon worked under a variety of names, recovering and protecting divine relics all over the East.  He was best known for designing the defenses of the water-temple of Lisaanda off the coast of Ild-Ann, which reputedly housed the sun-spear of Jukanza.  Over a hundred years after Gammon’s death the Academy mounted a large armed expedition to recover the powerful divine artifact.  Twelve hundred people -- almost the entire expedition -- were killed when the temple and the island it rested on sank into the ocean.  Afterwards, doubts surfaced as to whether the sun-spear had ever even been there.

Magi Gammon has been connected to two other rumored caches of magical lore: one in the Elven lands (the Marshal’s Glass) and another in Ild-Eldir (Vultip’s Library).
