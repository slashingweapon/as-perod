==Introduction== 

It is the greatest armada in a thousand years, the Emperor Sidir’s devastating Exodus played in reverse. The new fleet is as motley as the old one: a smattering of genuine war vessels escorting hundreds of unlikely crafts of all kinds. More than a few ships proved not to be seaworthy, while others fell to pirates, vicious storms, and inhabitants of the sea. The seaworthy, the lucky, and the well-armed found land in the winter of 1148. It was only a few rocks barely within sight o the continent, but they built a shrine to Fharlanghn there and named it the Traveler's Sign. From there the armada split into three fleets, each with its own objective and destination.

Admiral [Clegmaroon](Clegmaroon.html) commands the western fleet, with over 30,000 souls in his care. A huge number of the emigres are former slaves, escaped or liberated from their masters in the Principalities at the end of the [Righteous War](Righteous War.html). Others were free gnomes already when they joined the expedition. The occasional Arcanist, quite a few clerics, and the rare non-gnome round out the population. The Admiral safely guided his remaining ships (minus one that ran aground on the Dragon’s Teeth) to the [Bay of Tears](Bay of Tears.html). Disembarkation began immediately and proceeded quickly: many ships were simply run aground and cannibalized for building materials. Almost overnight, a small city began to take shape on the salt flats of the bay.

Key to the success of this racial adventure is the Mapping and Scouting Service, administered by Colonel [Quintain Ulstradie](Quintain Ulstradie.html). His charge is to look before anyone else leaps, which he does by dispatching teams of talented adventurers into the wild. The information he collects informs the Admiral and the governing board.
