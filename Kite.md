This popular spell flattens the caster, making her several times wider, 50% taller, much thinner, and capable of catching the wind.  For the duration of this spell the caster is able to ride the air, traveling through the air at close to the speed of the wind.  The user can only travel in the direction of the wind plus or minus 15 degrees.  Altitude can be gained or lost at 10 feet per round.  This use requires at least a moderate wind (11-20mph).

An alternate use of the spell involves a harness costing 10gp, worn by the caster and attached to a long silken line (10gp per 50 feet).  One end of the line is anchored while the caster flies on the end like a kite.  In this configuration the caster cannot move beyond the end of his tether, but he does gain some other forms of maneuverability.  He can gain or lose altitude at 60 feet per round, fly at a 90 degree angle to the wind, and fly in light winds.

When the spell ends the caster resumes her former shape over the course of a minute, losing altitude accordingly.  It is entirely possible for a caster to fall a great distance if they aren't careful.

Using this spell in high winds is very dangerous.  Loss of control sends the caster hurtling along with the wind, possibly running into the ground or obstacles.  The save DCs to avoid losing control are:

|| **Wind Severity** || **Wind Speed** || **Reflex Save DC** ||
|| Severe || 31-50 mph || 18 ||
|| Windstorm || 51-74 mph || 24 ||
|| Hurricane || 75-174 mph || 30 ||
|| Tornado || 175-300 mph || 40 ||

A masterwork harness (150gp) grants a +4 to these saves.

*Material Component:* A feather from a vulture, seagull, albatross, or other large soaring bird.
