[[#Handoff]]
**2 Winter 1147, Somewhere**

Minzerek is awake, on the ground covered by a blanket. His rescuer offers to release him from his shackles, if he promises not to try and escape. Someone paid handsomely to have him alive, but that doesn’t mean she can’t hurt him. She has all his things, stolen from under the nose of the Academy before he was even arrested, and tells him to make himself presentable.

As darkness falls, six griffons come down from the sky bearing riders. One is a dwarf, and a female no less. Her name is Rizzal. She explains that the Academy is using the Veil against [[E’Shyris]], causing all dwarven births in the last week to be stillborn. It is the end of their people, unless the power of the Academy can be broken.

The dwarven heirophant, the house mothers, and also the oracle of fire, have all said that now is the time. The oracle says the best chance lies with Minzerek taking up the quest, but Rizzal is prepared to take it up in his absence. Minzerek, although he has misgivings about Aidan, agrees to rejoin his former companions who are already on the quest.

Before leaving, Rizzal gives a package to the half-elf woman who rescued Minzerek. She unwraps it briefly: it looks like a piece from a very ornate suite of armor, crafted from mithril. The strange woman seems satisfied with her payment.

Before Minzerek leaves on the back of a griffon, she tells him, “If you are ever in Arducia again and need aid, ask about for the Gray Lady. I’ll find you soon thereafter.”

[[#ELF]]
**3 Winter 1147, the Desert Highway**

Near dawn, the main party encounters the highway that crosses the desert. Worried about scouts from the gathering army, the debate for a long time about how best to proceed. The sun comes up while they’re talking, and sheds light on a long line of slaves being marched towards Arducia. They decide to attack, and free the slaves. To throw suspicion from themselves, the party is disguised as members of the Elf Liberation Front. After today’s event, the organization might actually exist.

The 300 or so elf slaves are guarded by a man on a horse, an ogre, and a few dozen men with pole-arms and nets. The party hides itself in an illusionary sand-dune, and springs to the attack as the slavers pass by. Cadamus opens the combat by charming the ogre, which keeps the combat one-sided. The men with polearms try repeatedly to bring down the riders, but only succeed in tripping Basil once. The netters manage to entangle Nadia, but can't keep her for long. Earkey blasts a whole bunch of the men-at-arms into blindness with divine magic, and Cadamus follows up with a fireball that finishes them all off.

When an illusion of a company of elven archers (all decked out in ELF gear) appears on the sand dune, the slavers give up. It doesn't take long to free the prisoners and send them on their way. They are all women and children, the men having been called away or killed.

A flight of griffons lands a few hundred feet distant, and one of the riders dismounts. It is Minzerek. Aidan tries to greet the other griffon riders, but they retreat. It seems they aren't interested in talking.

Minzerek explains little of how he got away, other than the griffon riders employed someone else to free him.

[[#Town]]
**5 Winter 1137, a small Eboan town**

The party discovers a town overrun by zombies. They elect to kill the zombies thoroughly, but without divine magic. The zombies become truly dead again. There is just one family left, servants of the landholder here. They expect her back any day now, with an army.

The family explains that there was an illness going around the township the month before, and about fifteen people died. The warding paste they used on the graves was useless, and all of the dead turned into undead at the next new moon. This seems rather extreme, since normally only some of the dead come back as undead.

The party examines the local Arcane GP's quarters, but find little of interest. He didn't seem to be terribly advanced.

[[#Kepharix]]
**7 Winter 1137, Kepharix**

The party enters town, under yet another set of disguises, and get the latest news:
* The Lord Marshall Yousef has mustered an army of over 100,000 strong, and plans to begin marching any day now.
* The Academy has labeled the Dwarven nation of [[EShyris]] a cultist state, and has demanded access to the Forge of the First Fathers. The dwarves have refused. Over the last week or so, all dwarven babies have been stillborn.

There are very few sea-going vessels to choose from here. Most of the boats are best suited to the river or shallow water. The party decides to ride for [[Blackwater]].

[[#Blackwater]]
**10 Winter 1137, [[Blackwater]]**

Cadamus arranges for a safe house in Blackwater, and they begin looking for a ship. Nadia and Aidan see that Capt. Valar's Pharon is supposed to arrive in a week, and insist they try to charter his ship. Cadamus is unsure about employing someone they are known to associate with, but Aidan would rather have someone of good character.

People go shopping. It has been a long time since they've been able to do that.

[[#Valar]]
**13 Winter 1137, [[Blackwater]]**

Valar's ship is early. As is his custom, he takes over a room on the second floor of the //Black Scupper// as his office, and conducts his business from there. Cadamus (in disguise) and Aidan (posing as "Lady Sylvia") meet and discuss terms. The man is terribly suspicious, but agrees to think about the proposal and meet with Cadamus the next day. Valar has his prospective clients secretly followed after the meet, but both Cadamus and Aidan ditch their tails.

On the 14th, they meet again and Valar agrees to take on the party. The price is 3,000gp. The planned departure date is the 17th, after he has had time to make minor repairs and take on provisions.

[[#Departure]]
**17 Winter 1147, [[Blackwater]]**

After some division of treasure and a lot of shopping, the party departs. Capt. Valar is not fooled by today’s disguises at all, and seems to know the destination already. There may be a problem, however: A ship chartered by the Academy left the day before. The party will almost certainly encounter them during the journey.

The party tells Valar that they can provide extra provisions, thus avoiding the Per’moso isles and cutting nearly a week off of the trip.

[[#Kraken]]
**30 Winter 1147, the Western Seas**

The seas have been rough off and on, which is to be expected during the winter months. But on this day a normal rainstorm becomes a squall in less than a minute. The captain sends everyone below, but soon thereafter something huge rams the ship.

People head to the deck, and discover the sailors are fighting against tentacles. It is a kraken! The party fights off the beast, and repairs the damage to the ship.

//combat xp:// 580xp

[[#Drowning]]
**34 Winter 1147, the lagoon at Oracle Island**

The //Pharon// pierces the clouds and rough seas around the oracle’s island, and Valar guides the ship through the narrow channel as neat as you please. As they enter the lagoon, they find another sailing vessel and a very large galleon moored there. The two ships fly no color, their sails are in tatters, and the galleon has a damaged hull. They look abandoned, but Earkey warns that there are undead aboard.

As the //Pharon// approaches, a hundred undead swarm the decks of the galleon and begin trying to board the //Pharon//. A few of them (one seems to be the former captain) are very powerful, and have an ability which causes people to drown, even though they aren’t in water. Several sailors die from this effect alone.

Ambrose and Earkey destroy the lesser undead by the dozen, and the survivors back up until they are no longer in the drowning aura. With a combination of magic and brute force, the drowning undead are killed ... dead.

The galleon is very large, hasn’t been there more than a few weeks, but is damaged to the point of no longer being seaworthy. The other ship anchored in the lagoon seems to have been there much longer, perhaps over a year. A few rowboats can be seen on the shore of the island.

//combat xp:// 1540xp
//treasure:// three small chests of gold and jewels worth 35,000gp (the galleon payroll)
>> Minus 7,600gp for Cpt. Valaar and Crew

[[#Barrier]]
**35 Winter 1147, the lagoon at Oracle Island**

After lengthly discussions, the party decides to use //Stone Shape// to block off the reef, and send the //Pharon// into the fog surrounding the island, where Valar and crew will be out of the way. The party takes to the island. It appears that a broad path has been cut straight into the jungle from the beach, wide enough for two men abreast, but it was cut weeks ago. The jungle has already begun to reclaim it.

The party keeps watch for the Academy-chartered ship they know left [[Blackwater]] the day before them, thinking to attack their crew when they try to set foot on the island. After eight days, they decide they’ve waited long enough and head towards [[Iyeru and Tygea]]’s tomb.

[[#Lovers]]
**43 Winter 1147, [[Iyeru and Tygea]]’s tomb**

Everyone approaches the tomb invisible, and good thing, too. An invisible wizard and two [[White Guard]] (now his undead minions) attempt to ambush the party. //Black Tentacles//, a //Cloudkill// effect, some //Glitterdust//, a //Spiritwall//, and other magical hokery-pokery make the combat interesting. But the enemy cannot stand before the party’s combined might. The undead are destroyed, but the wizard escapes up the secret staircase (which stands open) leaving a //Wall of Force// in his wake. By the time the party dispels the tentacles and the poison and the walls, the wizard is long gone.

Several minutes, and thousands of steps, later the party encounters a constriction in the stairway. As they work to get by it they are attacked by earth elementals. Once through, they face two wizards and a live White Guard. The battle doesn’t last long at all, with the wizards being very surprised at how un-invisible they are to Nadia. She nearly kills one with a single blow, the White Guard is mastered in mere moments, and the remaining wizard leaves by some unknown means.

The captured wizard is Herman Smithman (Hu Ma), Mage Lord of the Necromancy Chair on the Arcane Council.

The escaped wizard is Ruholand Grips (Dw Ma), Mage Lord of the Elemental Earth Chair on the Arcane Council.

[[#ByeIsland]]
**44 Winter 1147, The lagoon at Oracle Island**

After much interrogation, some chicanery, and a significant amount of discussion, the party decides what to do with their captives Herman the evil wizard, and Georgios the tiny warrior. Herman is //Feeblemind//ed and placed into Georgios' care. They are deposited into the //Pharon//'s secure chamber, and Cpt. Valar will transport them to [[Blackwater]]. Valar will take the horses with him to Corisat, stopping along the way to do his usual trade.

[[#Forge]]
**44-48 Winter 1147, [[E'Shyris]]**

The party teleports to a Dwarven city deep in the mountains of [[E'Shyris]], to Minzerec's mother house. There they are greeted with some alarm, hidden, and allowed to rest. They are met by the Low Narcheska of the Granitehelms, who agrees to aid them in their journey to the Forge of the First Fathers. The party is stuffed into a pair of carriages drawn by teams of white-eyed lizards, and relayed through the deep realms non-stop until they reach a temple.

Beneath the feet of Moradin is a passageway which leads to a giant cavern and underground lake, which the party crosses to find a town built around a sizeable flow of magma. The master of the forge is Master Guthrock, and he recognizes Basil's sword almost instantly. He suggests the way to summon the oracle is to temper the Sword of the Desert Wind in the forge's heat, and quench it in water from the nearby lake.

For a day and a night, Basil tempers his sword. The gathered dwarves marvel at the complete lack of fire resistance of elven hair. Suddenly, a huge fire elemental arises from the Magma, and exclaims that he has waited a long time for this day to come, but that the Sigil is not free: a sacrifice must be made. He demands the sword, which Basil gives up after some thought.

//roleplay xp:// 300

[[#Golem]]
**48 Winter 1147, Forge of the First Fathers**

An Iron Golem appears at the forge, and squashes some dwarves. It goes directly after Ambrose, so the party lures it into the boiling hot magma in an attempt to melt it. Not being very smart, it falls for the trap and disappears into the pool of magma. After a few rounds it re-emerges, white hot and very healthy. Tricky-Wizard-of-Many-Names turns Ambrose invisible, so the Golem goes after Earkey. He just manages to get a hold of the little guy, when Master Guthrock shows up with adamantine longspears and passes them out.

With the party properly armed, the Golem is quickly felled and falls on top of Earkey, nearly killing him.

The dwarves seem thrilled, both at witnessing the Oracle, and at the opportunity to work with genuine used golem pieces.

Knowing that Basil gave up a singular weapon to the Oracle, and being in a rather uncharacteristically good mood from the day's events, Master Guthrock favors the elf with a trip to the armory. It yields an Adamantine Golem Bane Quickblade +1, a 500-year blade named Na-Gomi. It is a princely thing with a long list of battles to its name. This is a loan: the elf is expected to provide for its return to the deep armory when he dies. (Dwarves think quickblades are a little silly, but they make a few as interesting oddities.)

//combat xp:// 1160

[[#Oxhed]]
**49 Winter 1147, [[Oxhed]]**

The party teleports to Oxhed, which is under siege by 20,000 Soubous troops.

Also in the news:
* The new King of Aspera is King Nathaniel, formerly Count of Nychanter.
* [[Maedyn]] is also under siege, by the main body of the Soubous Army, around 100,000 troops.
* Jamyt, the Duke of [[Newholy]], has not entered the fight against Soubous.

The party finds Heirophant Danbur, and he gets them started on the [[Rite of Te]]. Danbur gives them some guards too, among them ~Sleestack. Once the party is in the sacred grove, the oracle gives Ambrose a starry fruit from one of the trees. He eats it, and dies. The oracle revives him. Ambrose loses some of his former ability, but gains others. Upon being resuscitated, the bishop seems haggard and weary, as would be expected after such an arduous event, but at the same time, he seems strangely hale. Without being noticeably larger, Bishop Ambrose projects a subtle strength and wherewithal that he did not possess before. But while some changes may lack obvious definition, one change is immediately apparent: his eyes have lost nearly all of their previous color. What were previously hazel are now nearly white, so that when open, Ambrose's eyes seem to lack irises altogether. His vision, so he says, has not altered functionally.

The party leaves the oracle in haste and, on their way out of the mountain, encounter two beulettes wreaking havoc. The beasts have been tearing through the mountain passages for over half an hour, and have eaten quite a few people. They are trying to get into the chamber of the High Court, but the iron doors hold them off long enough for the party to engage them.

After a hard slog of a fight, the beulettes die. Beulettes digest everything, even metal. So there are no ass pennies.

//combat xp:// 675 @ 9th level

[[#kTown]]
**50 Winter 1147, Mosyph's Highway**

After talking it over, the party elects to tackle the Oracle of Shadows. The theory is that, since it is closest to the Academy, it would be best if the party goes there before the Academy cottons on to what they're doing. It is also a bit of a problem, in that nobody (not even Ghaucia's Shadow) knows exactly where this thing is. The last expedition to try and find it was lost -- and that was 900 years ago.

The other problem with persuing the Oracle of Shadow is that the GM is unprepared.

The party rests, scries a location in the highway known to Nadia, and teleports. Because the distance is so great, they have to briefly layover in the Badlands.

Our heroes arrive in an underground town of kobolds. They are a broken and frightened people, much in decline since Nadia's last visit. When asked for news, they don't know anything about the Arcane Academy or about any gate or any symbols.

[[#gate]]
**56 Winter 1147, Mosyph's Highway**

A week of traveling the subterranean road brings the party to within a few days of the city of [[Soubous]]. The path is dotted with rest stops, decorated with murals depicting a variety of myths mashed together into an ungainly Myth of Everything. There are barriers along the way: cavern walls that are only mostly real, but which can be passed through with a little effort.

On her last trip through here, Nadia made rubbings of the murals and carvings at the various rest areas. Each was marked with a kind of identifiable signpost, which matched a known landmark above ground. (Hordengurst Cemetary, the Township of Fintz, the Jewelip Hills, etc..) The party finds the one they are looking for: the signpost for "The Gate". There is a brief encounter with a pair of cloakers.

That part of the highway crosses a large cave complex, which the party searches. They find a huge black archway carved into the stone, but with no passage beneath it. Carved into arch, in an ancient tongue, are the words "Pass through, but beware. What lies beyond is like your world, and yet unlike it."

Believing this to be the gate to the Oracle of Shadow, our intrepid adventurers try a lot of silly things to get it to open. They fail.

//Combat XP:// 200 @ 9th level

[[#graves]]
**57 Winter 1147, Through the Gate**

After some rest and reconsideration, Minzerec says they ought to use the Academy planar widget rods. Sure enough, with a little stick-waving and some magic words, the gate opens.

What lies beyond is more passageway. Older, narrower, and not as well made, but more tunnel nonetheless. It isn't long before the party encounters stairs, which climb far enough to make a well-toned pair of thighs burn. At the top of the stairway lies a pair of iron doors which swing outward, or at least they would if they weren't barred from the other side. The doors are above the stairs and slanted, much like being in a storm cellar. What's-His-Name does one of his near-miraculous skill checks, and gets the doors open.

The PCs find themselves in a near-colorless twilight world, in the middle of a very large cemetary on a hill. Monuments and headstones surround them, with dates spanning from close to a year of zero, to over fifteen thousand. Whether these "years" are the same as their native years is hard to tell. Some exploration reveals that the older headstones are downhill, where time has worn them to lumpy nubs of stone. The larger monuments tend towards the macabre: many seem to depict the method of death of those whose names they bear. Someone notices that the door they came out of has several names written on it, each crossed out until the last: "Mage Lord Lucius, 15224-?????".

The party follows one of the paths that goes roughly downhill, towards the oldest graves. Near the bottom of the hill they find a gate, and the road goes on through and between a couple of other hills.

Some miles along they are assaulted by a dozens of small purplish humanoid-shaped plant things with claws. Mostly, it is a massacre in the party's favor. After killing a couple dozen of the bothersome little buggers, the rest run off.

[[#mistrynne]]
**58 Winter 1157, Mistrynne**

The road is long-unused, grown over with grass, running down into a broad plain where fitful gray-white grasses whisper to the never-ending twilight. Without a sun or stars to guide them, it is anybody's guess as to which way is North. An hour or two of marching reveals a light in the distance: a single large hill rising out of the plain, entirely covered with a city. One could not say that the city shines, exactly, because no light in this place ever truly shines. But the world is less dim there, and the travelers make for the city.

There is a respectable defense around the city, a thick stone wall 35' high that is well-guarded. At the gates, the party requests and is granted entrance. They are warned, of course, of the penalties of taking what isn't theirs or fighting within city limits. Legal Statues are to be found in all five quadrants of the city, obolisks and such engraved with the most important laws, in case the party has questions. Ignorance of the law will be no excuse.

At the top of the hill is a strange combination of park and parthenon, with two floors of offices above the first course of pillars. The guards inform the party that they are early, but they are expected and can go right up. At the top floor they knock on the door, and are bidden to enter.

Mage Lord Lucius, Master of the City of Mistrynne, is busy signing and stamping various papers. "You are early," he says without looking up, "outside the standard deviation of probabilities. But still within the predicted range. So that's something." He is a bookish-looking man, who has little time for fools. It bothers him to no end that the party seems entirely unprepared, without "Heliotraunt's Precise Shift", or "Mackerel's Method of Retrieving the Inanimate from a Known Coterminous Juncture" (a.k.a., "the Mackerel"). With no planar travel at their disposal whatsoever, they shall have to retrieve something full of Shadow Magic, and not just some illusionary baubble, thank you very much.

"Go and kill Nightwing," says the Master of the City, "and bring me his heart. Or maybe the stone from his brain. Either one works. You can't miss him, he's about fifty feet wide and shaped like a bat made of darkness. Lots of competent folk have gone up on his mountain to kill him and died for it, so I wish you good luck. No use asking for my help, this is YOUR quest, so you have to do it or else it doesn't count. Good day, and don't bother coming back without the necessary item."

The party goes down a floor and crowds around the reference desk in the library, to ask about the thing they are supposed to kill. Nightwing is indeed a badass, and can kill with a touch, drain the magic from armor and swords, cause darkness, and you need silver+magic weapons to harm it. Minzerec sticks around in the library while the rest of the party goes shopping.

Minzerec learns that the city of Mistrynne, in its current form, has only been around for 900-ish years (if "The Clock" can be trusted). There used to be a kind of hermitage here, where an oracle used to live and occasionally tell the future. One day Lucius shows up, and the next thing anyone knows he's the new oracle. A few weeks later, hordes of undead overran the plain and destroyed the settlements here. Lucius raised up the hill on the site of the old hermitage, and the walls around it, and welcomed inside anyone who was willing to serve the city (which also means serving its Master) and obey its rules.

Nominally, Mistrynne is a client city-state to the Emperor Mosyph in Soubous. In fact, the emperor doesn't ask for much aside from a yearly tribute of electrum krones.

[[#Nightwing]]
**61 Winter 1147, Somewhere on the Plane of Shadow**

On top of a mountain, littered with ruins, the party encounters Nightwing. He is everything he was cracked up to be, and then some. He summons some Greater Shadows to fight with him, and they give the party a lot of trouble. The clerics eventually turn them, but can’t even come close to turning Nightwing. End the end our heroes prevail, of course. They crack open the monster’s skull and retrieve the stone.

The treasure is interesting. There are three sturdy chests, each holding 600 electrum [[krone]]s. The total is 3600 pounds of electrum. There is also assorted other gems and jewelry.

//Combat XP// 2300xp @ 10th level

[[#SSigil]]
**62 Winter 1147, Beneath Mistrynne**

After solving the logistics of transporting nearly two tons of treasure back to town, our heroes report to Lucius, with Nightwing’s stone in hand. He takes them deep under the city to basin. The stone is expended in a spell that transports Nadia to the Plane of Negative Energy -- an extraordinarily dangerous place. She plucks a thorn from the basin, which burrows under her skin. She doesn’t die.

The characters spend a couple more days in Mistrynne, shopping. Most importantly, Nadia finds a cleric than can cast regeneration, and restore her eyes and her wings. The merchants are very happy: it seems the recovered treasure is three years of tribute to the Emperor. For the last few years, the Emperor’s men would pick it up, but they got raided by Nightwing on the way to Soubous.

[[#Homeward]]
**65 Winter 1147, Leaving Mistrynne**

The party leaves Mistrynne, and heads back to the graveyard. On the way, they are assaulted by a Shadow Spider. It tries to coat everyone in greasy silk, but only Ambrose slips and falls. Minzy flies him out of trouble. The fighters get pretty torn up, as it keeps grabbing at them. Some healing is required. Minzerec uses Ray of Dizyness, and everything goes downhill for the spider from there.

After the fight, the party finds the spider's lair and treasure, then makes their way through the graveyard, down into the passage, and through the gate. Back on their home plane, it doesn’t look as though anyone followed them into the underground cavern.

The party prepares to teleport to Nychanter, via their usual relay point in the badlands.

**65 Winter 1147, Badlands**

Upon arriving at their usual relay point, the party finds itself first sinking into a quicksand-like substance, which then hardens to rock. Nadia and Ambrose are trapped. Green rays shoot from a “sand dune” in the north and hit Locklass and Minzerec. They are dimensionally anchored, and cannot teleport. Two hundred archers, flanked by cavalry, begin to shower the party with arrows, and three flesh golems shamble into the fray.

It’s an ambush. Aidan and Basil attack the golems, while Locklass attempts to see into the dune. Minzy polymorphs to become a blue dragon, burrows into the ground to free Nadia and then Ambrose. Some low-level wizards use lightening to heal the golems, someone uses Fireball, and lots and lots of arrows come down all over the place. By sheer luck, the golems take more damage from the arrows than the party does.

Locklass gets See Invisible working, and recognizes the fireball came from none other than Magi Leeman. He puts Glitterdust on Leeman (very bad for him) and shouts out to the party. Aidan smites Leeman. Minzerec feebleminds Leeman. Then Nadia flies over to him and kills him a lot. The attackers all break off, leaving our heroes in possession of the field and a dead body. They take Leeman’s corpse and teleport to Nychanter.

[[#Swamp]]
**69 Winter 1147, the swamp formerly known as Ild-Eldir**

It has been an easy few days, for a change. The party’s sudden appearance in the courtyard of the stronghold ruffled a few feathers, but a cheer goes up as people recognize Bishop Ambrose and the Sisters of Ardengard. People assume they have come to put an end to the lizardfolk skirmishes.

They meet with the duke (Martin Guy, Duke of Nychanter), who is also the son of the new King. He is very young, but seems capable. The Duke is disappointed that they haven’t come to fight the war, but as Aidan and Nadia assure him they fight the Academy, he’s willing to go along. He hasn’t forgotten the help Aidan has given his family in the past, and the fact that most of the party has massive prices on their heads (wanted by the Academy, dead or alive, 50kgp each) gives them some credibility as well.

To get the oracle, the party will have to paddle their way through hundreds of miles of salt marsh then head off-shore several miles. Along the way they will have to face tribes of lizardfolks, various monsters, and pass through the territory of Beula the Black Dragon, ensconced in her lair in the ruined city of Dunns.

They draw a few things from the Duke’s armory, borrow a sturdy shallow-draft boat with twenty experienced crew, and break through the lizardman lines under a hail of fiery trebuchet rounds. The party experiences a few minor scrapes with lizardfolk (not enough to gain any xp) before the first serious engagement.

Three days out, the party is attacked by a Swamp Hag and two Chuul. The new underwater equipment is put to good use, and the bad guys die.

[[#Blackscale]]
**73 Winter 1147, Swamps of Ild-Eldir**

The party’s boat is attacked by archers, swarms of fat black wasps, and a team of really big blackscale lizardmen.  They have huge flails which shoot out manticore spikes.  They nearly kill Erkey in the opening moments of combat.  Ambrose puts up a wall of wind to keep out the wasps, avoiding what kinds of trouble only the gods know.  Lockless confuses the archers, who then spend more time fighting each other (or running away) than shooting at the boat.  Aidan and Nadia put the beatdown on the blackscale lizardmen.  Only one gets away.

Soon afterwards, the party encounters by a ten-headed pyrohydra.  This must be an unusually intelligent hydra, because it apparently understands enough of what Erkey says to become enthralled by his soothing voice and assurances of friendship.  After all these years, Erkey got lucky and found something he could use that spell on. 

**76 Winter 1147, Beula's Tower**
The party invades the lair of Beula the Black, the dragon that rules this area.  They fight her Ooze monster, and then attack her personally.  But she escapes, taking much of her treasure with her.

The lizardmen, faced with powerful adventurers and without the dragon to lead/intimidate them, let the heroes do whatever they want.  The even help out some.

**78 Winter 1147**
The Academy sends a messenger.  They want the party to stay out of the conflict in Aspera.  In exchange, the Academy will remove the bounty on the party members.  The party pretty much tells the Academy they can shove it.

**79 Winter 1147**
The party finds the wicker colossus where they are supposed to meet up with Valaar.  Some halflings are prisoners in the colussus, to be sacrificed by burning.  The party rescues them, and take the halflings with them onto Valaar's ship when he arrives.

The halflings are what is left of the Nympharia's crew.  They are Thronys, Semys, Aphothen, Temnotus.  They were on a mission to transport the household effects of princess Myrine to Mosinongo.  But a giant sea-turtle capsized their boat, and then they were captured.

Valaar has a new ship, the Pharon II.  He captured the new ship when it attacked the old one.  It was an Academy ship, looking for some "holy men".  

**85 Winter 1147**
The Pharon II enters the territory of a powerful Sahuagin tribe, who agree to let them pass in exchange for two Flails of the Manticore.

The party meets with the Oracle, a massive sea turtle named Kantunilatlan.

**5 Spring 1147**
The Pharon II docks in Mosinongo, the Ild-An capital city.  Buildings all round the harbor are built like the prows of ships, many of them made of stone.  The party goes to the palace to meet Myrine, who is engaged to be the ninth wife of the king.  She is grateful that her valued retainers have been returned to her, even if her belongings have not.

**7 Spring 1147**
The party tries to gain admittance to the the Temple of the Sun, but it turned away by a low-level functionary.  They surmise that the Academy has a presence there, and is trying to keep them from seeing Ochien, the "God" who lives there.

**8 Spring 1147**
Locklass cons his way into the temple.  The whole party gets inside to find Ochien is a Coatl, who has been drugged almost into thralldom by his head "priestess".  One of the clerics cures him of his addiction, there is a brief stuggle against the priestess (who escapes) and the god reasserts control over his temple again.

Ochien agrees to bestow the key on Aidan in exchange for her help in propagating his race.

With all seven keys accounted for, the party itself constitutes a new interface to the Veil Mechanism.  They elect, with very little debate, to shut it down.
