title: Ild-Eldir
---

Ild-Eldir was once a country of mostly humans covering the [[Yeron]] delta and several outlying islands, stretching west along the coast for two hundred miles beyond the delta.  The delta was marsh land with occasional high ground large enough to support thriving towns and even a few cities.  Low-lying areas were often populated by lizardfolk   Areas immediately outside the delta were arid and always sparsely populated, with small communities clustered near shallow wells and oases.

In 989-991CE a series of high floods, undersea earthquakes, and tidal waves washed most of the human settlements off the map.  After a staggering loss of life and the ruination of every coastal city for three years running, humans left the coastal areas for good.  A relative few tried to return, but periodic flooding and a relentlessly sinking coastline repeatedly drove them away.  Eventually, the refugees made their homes in [[Aspera]] or wherever they happened to have found shelter.  It was this sudden influx of immigrants coupled with disease and famine that ultimately caused Aspera to erupt into war and disintigrate.

Since then the delta has been entirely settled by lizardfolk, who live in numerous tribes camped wherever there is high ground.  Outsiders who want to wander freely through the delta must obtain the forbearance of the appropriate tribes.  There are few safe corridors through the delta, navigable estuaries that flow from the [[Yeron]].  Lizardfolk often compete for control of these valuable shipping lanes. 

Off-shore is about 20 miles of coastline that fell into the ocean in the yars of flooding.  Several cities and other important sites lie under coastal waters including the former human capital of [[Saunders]], the palace of [[Chetwode]], and the temple to the ocean goddess [[Euphrasia]].

Ruins of human habitation on land are still to be found on occasion, exposed by the ever-shifting marsh.
