= Overview =

Perched on a low hill overlooking miles of fertile valley is the house of the Baron of Lemonfall.  Spread before it is the town of Lemonfall, and beyond that lies several miles of fertile valley grazing land and orchards.  The northern slopes of the surrounding hills are terraced for grapes.

The town was founded by [Andronicus](Andronicus.html) in CE 1110.

= Geography =

Lemonfall is the seat of the barony of Gideon Valley, which runs through the forest from the Creche in the northwest to the plains in the southeast.  The surrounding hills drain into a modest river, the Smallwine, which flows southeast and eventually joins the Yeron.  Only fifty miles of the valley is inhabited, leaving almost another hundred miles unsettled.  Travelers who explore the valley would find the ruins of many forgotten hamlets and villages.

Lemonfall is centered around a large cobblestone square flanked on one side by a large meeting hall, and on the other side by a new administrative building.  Like most central squares, this acts as a main gathering place, staging area, marching ground, open market, and execution grounds.  To the east spreads "old town", with the original buildings made during the first few years of settlement, often on older foundations.  These include the cooper, lumberer, wagoneer, blacksmith, and other essential establishments.  To the west is the newer building and the houses of many farming and laboring classes of people.  

The south of the town is bounded by the main road that runs through the valley, and across this road and a little to the west is a series of large estates on north-facing hills -- the vines, homes, and storage facilities of the wealthiest people in the barony.  The north is bordered by orchards and, beyond them, forested hills.  

Finally, there is the "north road" which cuts through the forest and winds through the lowest parts of the hills ending up in [Saltdown](Saltdown.html).  Where the road first meets the forest is several acres of very large trees.  That is called the "traveler's camp", and it is where the elves set up their tents during the harvest.  During the rest of the year you can sometimes find other groups of people there, of the sort that pass through town but have the means to provide their own shelter.

= Locations =

== Meeting House ==

This large building was renovated from ruins by the founders of Lemonfall.  In fact, they lived in the unrenovated building during the first few months of the founding.  It holds up to five hundred uncomfortable people on the main floor, and another two hundred in the balcony.  Seating is hard benches facing one end of the room.  The benches are made to stack so they can be moved out of the way when the space is needed for special events.

The doors of the building are heavy hardwood bound by iron.  Just inside the doors on one side is a large copper bas relief image of the "four founders": Andronicus Sangtree, Rider-Mentor Perisas, Rider Penymos, and Rider Ospheros.  On the other side is another one depicting the other thirty or so people who helped to found the town, including many who are still living in the area.  They are shown in various posses, rebuilding the meeting hall as it stands today.  The reliefs were commissioned and erected in a fit of civic well-meaning after the death of Penymos, the last of the four founders.

The building is quite old, and was hardly more than a ruin when Andronicus Sangtree discovered the abandoned vinyards of the valley (now called Gideon Valley) and decided to re-establish the village.  For the first few months the settlers lived in the old building while they made the land productive again and brought in the first harvests.  With the help of elven crafters they renovated the building.  

== Administration ==

This square one-story building houses the daytime offices of the Sherrif, recorder, crown auditor, baron, and a stone-walled jail with four cells.  The center of the building is open to the sky and houses a small garden, a luxury ordered by Iaden.

The records are fairly extensive and keeping them up to date employs two scribes full-time.  There is rarely anyone in the jail cells, but the sherriff and his helpers are almost always out and about.

Iaden's daytime receiving chambers are here, a set of small but well-appointed rooms.  On her desk are well-thumbed, heavily bookmarked copies of Pherad's [Land Management](Land Management.html) and Oquai's [Forms and Protocols of Government](Forms and Protocols of Government.html), the canonical texts of Asperian administration.

Lemonfall has its own full-time crown auditor (a zelous man without humor named Fealous) because of the financial problems it had for several years under Lemandis.

== Healer & Herbalist ==

[Hirisu](perod-secrets:Lemonfall.html) (HA FM) used to live outside town, but with her children grown and her husband passed away she bought the lease to her tiny house with roon for a garden.  People come here for healing, locally-available herbs, poltices, and such.  

Hirisu has a Graymalkin named "Bobby", whom she sends on errands and is often seen running around the town.

== Longboard ==

This is the classic eating hall, where people gather in the evening for the largest meal of the day and have just one or two dishes to choose from.  Conversation and gossip are flow like the watered-down wine.  Characters can get an eadible meal for 3sp each, all you can eat and drink.  

== Blue Fruit Tavern ==

This is another of the original buildings dating back hundreds of years, once a very large manor house.  It was rennovated with a great deal of Elven workmanship and then sold to the one person Andronicus knew would take excellent care of it: madam Aegianne.  Elven architecture and stylings instantly became fashionable, and continue to have an impact on life in the valley.

The finest establishment for many miles around, this tavern offers a soft bed, good food, fine wine, pleasurable company, and gambling.  Many nights there are bards or other forms of entertainment.  It is run by the madam [Aegianne](perod-secrets:Aegianne.html), who makes sure the best and richest people in the county are well taken care of.  It isn't just men who come to the Blue Fruit.  Any travelers with sufficient means and a desire for good food and bedding might stop here.  If you have the coin, Aegianne has what you need.

== Blemming's Goods ==

Blemming's is located near the cooperage and the wagon lot, and is responsible for the import and export of much of the area's goods.  It has nearly all of the simple goods you might need in stock year-round.  Lothobearing Blemming (GN EX 4) is assisted by his wife Snowfox (GN EX 5) and their daughter Jaypetoriana (GN EX 1).  

== Laniry's Tailoring ==

Mostly you find bolts of cloth and large quantities of thread.  Jules Laniry (son of the original Laniry, HU COM 5) buys his goods from all over Aspera.  He keeps a small stock of valuable silks and patterned fabrics, and a generous selection of thread.  He runs the mercantile side of the business, while his wife (Enim) and two daughters (Hawese and Burilia) do the tailoring.  He also has a son (Ithe) doing his two years military service and living in the barracks.

Jules often gets embroidery and lace work from his wealthier clients, which he passes on to local women on the farms.  When he runs short of lace he gathers all the interested women together in the common hall for a day of socializing and needlework. 

== Cobbler Shop ==

[Belis](perod-secrets:Lemonfall.html) (HE COM 7) is the Cobbler in Lemonfall.  He is an ageing half-elf with no wife or children, just his apprentice Drasiri (HE COM 2).  In spite of his well-regarded practice and no family to support, he and his apprentice live rather meagerly above his shop.

== Blacksmith ==

Rodaos (GN EX 8) is the smith, and he runs his business with the help of his wife Fey, his daughter Niven, and his two apprentices Gantos (HU EX 1) and Rhemus (HA EX 2).

== Cooper ==

This is where people come for casks of all sizes, buckets, butter churns, coffins, and just about any other kind of wooden container.  The shop is two stories tall constructed from large posts and beams, with a sloped roof shingled in clay tiles.  The first-floor outside walls are cleverly made to be removable from the inside, which permits large objects to be moved in and out of the shop with ease.

Inside during the day the shop is a hive of activity, with a dozen apprentices of different races working under the supervision of Drystaff or his cohort Julia (HuFm Ex 5).  Over the last thirty years much of Gideon Valley has been populated and turned to vinticulture, and it takes a lot of casks lay up so much wine.

[Drystaff](perod-secrets:Lemonfall.html) is the master-cooper, a dwarf who moved to Lemonfall in its second year.  He is picky about who buys his ageing casks, figuring he shouldn't waste his time building fine casks for mediocre wine.  It was the unique *Wild Gideon* that brought him to Lemonfall in the first place.   

He and Baronet Iaden have a joint venture distilling wine to make *Old Baron* spirits, so named for her father Andronicus.  A mini-cask (about 10 bottles) is 20g if it is new, and costs an additional 10g for each 2 years it has aged.  The oldest batch is only 10 years old and costs 200g per mini-cask.  These same little casks sell for considerably more in places like Maedyn and Soubous.

== Academy Campus ==

The Academy campus is a modest building in the older part of town, a few doors away from the blacksmith shop.  Not the really the best location for study and reflection, but close enough to the Blue Fruit to make up for the noise from the anvil.  The GP for Lemonfall is a gnome named Jererack (GN MA Wiz 5) who has a single apprentice, Oldwarrak (HA FE Wiz 1).

The campus consists of a single two-story building, with a large classroom and non-magical texts on the bottom floor for educating the local children (the prime mission in Lemonfall), and living/studying/lab space at the top.  There is a small courtyard in back, which Jererack has his students clean or improve when they misbehave.

Aside from his campus duties, Jererack does magic for pay and keeps an alchemy lab (+20 Craft(Alchemy) check).
