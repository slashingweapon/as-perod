The krone is a symbol for standardization and officialdom throughout the Empire and its former client states.  The shape is a circle with a square cut from the center, often flanked by words or symbols specific to the context.  The symbol is used in many contexts.

* The Soubous Book of Law was a standard throughout the empire, and nearly all modern laws are descended from it.  Many law books still feature a krone on the cover.
* The imperial standard of weight is one krone (about 2 pounds).  Merchant scales are balanced with krone-shaped weights that are multiples/fractions of one krone.
* The krone shape, with words added at the four sides of the square, is often worn as a badge of office among anyone who carries legal authority.  People with supervisory responsibility usually wear their krones on a colored ribbon or lariat, the color and complexity of the knot denoting their level of responsibility.
* The imperial silver piece is krone-shaped.  Silver was and is the most important coinage throughout the empire.
* Large quantities of metal are formed into krone-shaped platters weighing one krone (2 lbs) each.  Stacks of these platters are typically threaded with a thick rope finished with a hand loop at one end for easy carrying.  All kinds of metals are smelted and traded in this form from tin and iron (2sp per krone) to silver (100sp per krone) to platinum (100pp per krone).
