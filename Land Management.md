Pherad's **Mangement of Agricultural, Forest, and Town Lands** is a core volume in any Asperan noble's library.  Although by no means the most exhaustive work on these topics, it presents fundamentals that no Baron can do without.  Crop rotation and fertilization, planting techniques, simple irrigation, selective cutting, game management, and town planning all get space in this no-nonsense tome of 160 pages.

The original work dates back to around 300 CE, when Pherad wrote the book to celebrate Asperan agricultural superiority over the cumbling Empire's failing yields.  The book was popular for a while, but fell into disuse after about a century.  King Tygar had the book revised during the reformation, and made it required reading for his nobles whose lands were principally agricultural in nature.  Since then it has been updated constantly, with sections added on forestry and small-town planning.
