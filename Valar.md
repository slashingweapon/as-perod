title: Valar
---

Born to a slave woman in Ild-Ann, he was a young child when he and his pregnant mother were purchased by an Eboan trader named Barley Ackfred.  After the mother died in childbirth, Barley and his brothers George and Brian freed the orphan and adopted him as a son.  As the Ackfreds were confirmed bachelors, sea merchants, and occasional smugglers, Valar was raised on the sea.

His ship, the Pharon, is a fast two-masted sailing vessel, with a crew of 12-20, and 125 tons cargo or 100 soldiers.  Valar prefers speed and an experienced crew over sheer numbers.
