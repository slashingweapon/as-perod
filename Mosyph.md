# Mosyph The Slave 

The details of the early life of Mosyph the Red Emperor are a mystery.  The little we do know of his youth explains much about the empire he built.

Mosyph was born a slave, the product of a slave girl and a house guest who took advantage of his host's hospitality.  The girl was hardly old enough to bear children and died in child birth.  He was raised by field workers until he was old enough to work in the master's house, where his beauty was considered a fitting ornament.  He was bought and sold repeatedly in a few short years, almost certainly as a prized sex object.  In time he was purchased by a magician who recognized in Mosyph not only a great natural beauty but a growing strength and a quick mind.

Mosyph's new master believed it fitting to educate his servant, so young Mosyph was educated in letters, riding, and the sword.  In those days of tiny kingdoms and frequent war a noble was often called to serve his liege in military campaigns.  The magician took Mosyph with him on campaigns, and they survived many bloody campaigns together as master and servant.  Much of the glory that went to the master belonged rightly to the servant, but Mosyph bore it for the sake of the love between them.  

Then came the day the master was betrayed by his own son and executed by their liege as a traitor.  The master had left instruction that Mosyph was to be freed upon his death, but the son did not honor the word of his father.  

The master's son, jelous of the affection his father had for a mere slave, took pleasure in demeaning Mosyph.  If Mosyph noticed a slave woman then the son would use her while Mosyph watched.  When there was any disorder in the house, it was Mosyph who bore the cane.  When the magician's son was challenged it was Mosyph who fought the duels and suffered the wounds.  The son was free with Mosyph's bedding, giving him to any who asked.  Mosyph felt every lash of the son's anger, disappointment, and ill temper.

Mosyph bore all of this, unable to free himself from the magic of his enslavement until the son became careless in battle.  Momentarily threated by the enemy, the son paniced and commanded Mosyph to "kill everyone".  Mosyph obeyed by separating the son's head from his shoulders.  He made good his escape from the battlefield and headed east.  

It took some weeks for the geas to run its course, and in that time Mosyph became the avowed enemy of fifteen kingdoms.  Nobles hunted him, and they were  welcomed with the point of his sword.  Thus his oppresors  eased the burden of his geas with their lives.  Mosyph killed all in his path, high and low alike.  But it seems he went to some pains to ensure it was the rich and the noble (slave owning classes) who bore the brunt of his compultion.

It is said that, when he was hungry, Mosyph would approach a town yelling at the top of his voice, dragging behind him the metal armor and heads of his noble victims.  People would flee him lest they be killed.  Mosyph would take whatever he could find in the streets to eat, then go back to the wilderness.  Rumor spread, and soon villagers would leave baskets of food outside and shut themselves indoors at night so the "Slaughtering Knight" would not see them.  

(This event may be the origin of the month of charity, where villagers and farmers set baskets of food outside their doorsteps every night in midsummer.)

In time the geas ran its course and Mosyph was no longer bound by the hated son's last command.  He hid his face and journeyed east, away from known lands.  Still hunted for his crimes, he traveled in secret.  After a year of running he reached the Great River [Yeron](Yeron.html).  In the night he stole a fishing boat, crossed the water, and was not seen again for neigh a human lifetime.

# Mosyph In The East 

As little as we know about Mosyph's youth, we know even less about his days beyond the Yeron.  Many greedy kings along the river have tried to extend their rule over it, but all such projects fail.  The far forests belong forever to the fey people, the second children of the gods, beings so wild enough they do not worship their own creators.

The fey, though powerful and capricious, are lovers of the beautifull and the curious.  An escaped human slave with the face of an angel who was also accomplished warrior must have been a fascinating creature to them.  Certainly, he gained the favor of some powerful entity to reside so long among the fey and learn so much of their lore.

Concerning that lore, Mosyph spoke seldom.  It was clearly arcane in nature, but his knowledge was more profound than a common mage's.  In his later years he sometimes mentioned in passing the "fourty-one tasks of the supplicant", but what they were he never did say.  Perhaps they correspond to the fourty-one base arcane symbols that can be gleaned from his magical writings, symbols which few other mages have ever fully understood.  

Only this much is certain: that when Mosyph emerged from his sojourn posessed of tremendous magical learning and a store of powerful tools.  His beauty and grace were likewise increased, perhaps a gift from his fey benefactor.

# Mosyph The Wanderer 

The future Emperor walked the inhabited lands for some years, often hiding his true face.  He traveled in various guises that allowed him to move freely: as an actor, a tinker's assistant, and a bard, among others.  Where the name Mosyph had been forgotten or was never known, he used his own name.  In other places he used the name Avalael, which sounds like the elven word for "flower child" but is the fey word for "beautiful stranger".  

The world inhabited by the Third Children he returned to was much as the one he had left: tiny nations formed alliances and borders which shifted yearly through marriage or war.  Elves lived in a diaspora lurking in the world's forests.  Dwarven tribes fought as much between themselves as they did the humans.  Halflings lived among the humans and gnomes, often as slaves.  Free Gnomes lived in loosely organized city-states behind the [Rakrodperkim](Rakrodperkim.html), warring a little more with the goblins than with each other.  

Almost everywhere, the stong ruled for themselves and the weak were mostly impoverished.  Slavery was a universal institution.  War was a game played by nobles with the lives of the commoners.  Learning of any kind was increasingly rare because the places of learning had long been razed.  Shrines and temples were rare outside of heavily fortified cities because so many wars had been fought under religious pretexts.

From time to time Mosyph would unveil himself to a trusted few, and pronounce his intention to create a single nation.  Such people formed the network of spies and followers who paved the way for his conquest.  

The future Emperor ended his wanderings in the far West, between the high mountains and the restless sea, among the humans called the Eld'che, in the place now known as [EssTina|Ess'Tina](EssTina|Ess'Tina.html).  They were a people who knew little of war and even less of slavery.  There he wooed and won the seeress [Y'syen](Y'syen.html) for his wife, whose only brideprice was the promise of a light rule upon her people.

# Mosyph, King Of Soubous 

Having walked the length and breadth of the lands he intended to conquer, Mosyph began his empire with a startling series of conquests in the interior, in the area now known as the Principality of Soubous.  When asked about this particular choice by a close follower, Mosyph is said to have replied "There are more slaves than free people in that place, and I have need of an army."

In five days of winter he took five kingdoms by the simple expedient of appearing in the throne rooms of their rulers, killing the royal families, and killing any other nobles who opposed him.  He imposed a book of law that did not differentiate between nobility and commoner.  Under this law, slaves were immeidately freed and the taxes nobles could collect were limited.  Nobles who did not like the new order of things were stripped of land and title, and commoners were raised in rank to replace them.  When Mosyph, now calling himself the King of Soubous, mustered an army in Spring he had an excess of willing recruits.

The neighboring kings were so terrified that they formed a "grand alliance" against him.  The usual style of alliances, always ones of convenience without trust, were weak and trembling things before such a large and motivated army as what the new King was able to field that year.  Unlike the campaigns they were used to, they were not allowed to play pawns with their foot soldiers.  Instead, Mosyph would gather his best warriors and ride with them directly at the nobility.  After several kings had died by Mosyph's sword, any noble who valued his life more than his power gave serious thought to surrendering to the Soubous King.

It didn't take long for some nobles to reach the conclusion that Mosyph's entire purpose was simply to free slaves.  They tried throwing ranks of slaves at his armies who, as it turned out, did not shy away from killing them.  More than once, these "slave shields" simply ran at the Soubous forces full-tilt and then surrendered.  A few nobles tried something more spectacular: they burned slaves alive rather than let "the Slave King" free them.  The new King's response was to guarantee a very slow death to any defeated noble who had used such a tactic.  

The planting season was barely over when suddenly the King of Soubous stopped his campaigns, set his borders, and threatened no one for four years.  In that time he set down his law, removed nobles who were recalcitrant or incompetent and replaced them with more talented commoners, set a single currency, established a judiciary, and made a practice of punishing bribe-takers.  In short, he built something the region hadn't seen in generations: a functional government.

His most surprising move was instituting the Great Library of the Arcane (which later became the [Arcane Academy](Arcane Academy.html)).  Mages who swore to serve the King of Soubous and donated a unique spell to the library could have access to its secrets for a reasonable fee.  In a time where magical learning was rare and spells were jelously guarded secrets, the temptation was too much for most magicians.  Above all else, a magician wants power, and aligning ones self with the King of Soubous was clearly the best way to get it.

The borders of Soubous remained open for trade and diplomacy during those few years.  Visitors were amazed at the intense industry of the new kingdom, the rapidly expanding road system, the thriving town centers, and the abundant crop yields.  So many people wanted to live in Soubous that three kingdoms closed their borderd to stem the flow of immigration.

Ambasadors saught assurances that King Mosyph would not expand his domain.  To this, Mosyph's answer was always the same. "The Kingdom of Soubous is complete.  It will not be extended."  Some ambasadors were comforted by this pronouncement, while a few took it as a most ominous sign.

These early years were not without challenges for the new king.  There were numerous attempts on his life and an insurrection of the nobility.  Even after stripping so many nobles of thier wealth, his treasury was strained by all the public works and the need to equip a growing army.  A pair of dragons decided to nest on the south border of the kingdom.  King Clonius (of Irius) and Queen Rilatia (of Lorius) were duplicating his government with some success.  Some of Soubous' neighbors grew leary of the huge army Mosyph was building, which was past all pretense of being defensive.  There was open talk of a preemptive war against Soubous.

In the fourth year of Mosyph's reign two events cleared his path for further conquest.  First, he was able to strike a treaty with the dragons.  Secondly, Clonius and Rilatia offered him their respective kingdoms.  It is hard to say which event was more astonishing.

# Bronze Wing And Golden Crown 

The dragons, Fanar and Nonutu, settled in the rocky hills and canyons south of Soubous because they were sparsely populated, difficult to cross, and easy to protect.  Most of the few inhabitants were bandits and other people who prefered to live outside any established law.  There were also veins of precious metals sprinkeld throughout the hills.  For two dragons looking to raise a clutch of young it was an ideal location.  

Mosyph knew of the male, Fanar, and his particular fondness for fine food.  In the early autumn he set up a camp near the dragons' den and set his best cooks to making a feast fit for a delegation of kings.  Besides the kitchen staff, Queen Y'syen, his best musicians, most courteous attendants, and six carefully chosen officials were the only others present.  The king instructed his people to welcome any strangers as honored guests, no matter how unsavory their appearance might be.

The full telling of their meeting and long association is recounted in the [Lay of Fanar and Nonutu](Lay of Fanar and Nonutu.html), but it bears telling here in brief.  Fanar wanted to test the audacious king on his doorstep, so he sent a poor gnomish family (complete with crying children) into the camp to see how they would be treated.  Mosyph not only feasted them like nobility, but sent them away at dawn with food and useful gifts.  The next night Fanar sent a dozen plagued outcasts into the camp.  Again, the strangers were greeted as nobility.  Mosyph and Y'syen tended to them, cured their various diseases, feasted them at their own table, and even offered to transport them safely to Soubous if they wished to become citizens.  

On the third night Fanar donned a disguise and told bandits about the rich king camped in the wilderness with no forces to protect him.  The bandits did the predictable thing and assailed the camp.  Before they ever stepped foot within the torchlight they became confused, blinded, and lost their weapons.  Mosyph strode out into the darkness and slew all but one, whom he left alive to relate the tale.

On the fourth night the king instructed his cooks to prepare the most grand meal yet.  At sundown, as the musicians were picking up their instruments and striking the first notes of the evening, the two great bronze dragons descended upon the camp and assumed the forms of a fey king and queen.  They were feasted and entertained like royalty.  Fanar and Mosyph talked until dawn of ancient things in many tongues, and traded fey lore like two gem merchants comparing their best-cut jewels.  Y'syen and Nonutu talked in the languages of earth and all living things, about the follies of their mates, and what the spirits of the land whispered when there were ears that could listen.

From a few small acts of faith those who might have been enemies instead became friends.  It was not always an easy friendship, but it lasted all the years of Mosyph's and Y'syen's lives.  It was from friendship that agreements on passage, protection, boundaries, and the other minutia of stathood were made and kept.  Certainly it increased the safety and wealth of all parties.  But at it's root it was a treaty of profound friendship rather than mere convenience.

## Clonius And Rilatia 

[Irius](Irius.html), [Lorius](Lorius.html), [Polocius](Polocius.html), [Undosia](Undosia.html), and [Rayolia](Rayolia.html) had once been the single nation of [Ososia](Ososia.html).  Time, greed, and civil war had long since split the nation into frequently warring states ruled by monarchs who were distant cousins to each other.  Two of these rulers, Clonius King of Irius and Queen Rilatia of Lorius, had wanted to marry for years but were prevented by the political implications.  Neither could they afford to make an open peace for fear the surrounding nations would then ally against them.

The chief lesson they learned from King Mosyph's rise to power was that an orderly and prosperous rule was possible provided the noble class could be brought to heel.  Their first step was to use the nobles' fears of being overshadowed by neighboring Soubous to press reforms that copied some of the successes king Mosyph.  Both nations saw a quick change in material fortunes while at the same time suffering from internal political pressures.  What was good for the kingdom clearly was not good for the nobles.

Rilatia pointedly sent copies of the [Soubous Book of Law](Soubous Book of Law.html), thinly disguised with a new title and minor changes, to her cousin monarchs.  Her message was clear: there would be one rule and one law in the one nation of Ososia.  Clonius took public offense and deployed a large part of his army on the border between his lands and hers.  In response, she did likewise.  The two armies stood barely a bowshot apart for most of the summer.  The three other monarchs, hoping the two would weaken each other irreparably in the coming conflict, took no position and deployed no forces.

It was during this stand-off that the two secretly signed a treaty with Mosyph pledging their fealty and making themselves client rulers.  What they asked in return was the permission to marry and his aid in conquering the remaining three states.  They were also promised an adjunct to the Arcane Library would be built in their capital, once their conquest was complete.  Whether they approached Mosyph because they needed his help to unify five warring states or because they were afraid of his army will always be a matter of some debate.  

The two returned separately to their military camps and prepared them for battle.  At dawn the next day the two "opposing" monarchs met in parlay where, to the surprise of both sides, they exchanged wedding vows and pronounced their joint intention of conquering (or unifying) the five splintered kingdoms of Ososia.  Their armies, already gathered, marched that day agains the kingdom of Polocius.  The remaining three kingdoms were ill positioned to fight and, with some help from the Soubous magicians, were beaten before the first snow.  As in Soubous, it would be years before Ososia was truly a settled nation, but it represented a border that Mosyph could concern himself with much less as he began the Ten Year Conquest.

# The Fields Of Garaus 

In the autumn before he began his war against all of [As-Perod](As-Perod.html) Mosyph borrowed an idea from Rilatia (then Queen of Ososia) and sent a beautifully crafted copy of the [Soubous Book of Law](Soubous Book of Law.html) to every sovreign he intended to conquer in the coming year.  It was a challenge that could not be ignored and this time the response was immediate and extreme: every king within a thirty day march of Soubous, twenty seven kings in all, invaded Soubous in late winter.  All told it was a war force over a quarter of a million strong.  It was a bold move designed to crush his forces before the proper campaign season had even begun.

Mosyph's strategy was to force the opposing kings to commit their forces in a set-piece battle they felt sure of winning.  To that end the Soubous army harried the larger allied forces, which gave chase and eventually surrounded them on a large flood plain still hard with frost, near the town of Garaus.  When Mosyph called for a meeting of parlay there was some debate among the allied kings as to whether they should accept or simply march on the badly outnumbered Soubous army first thing in the morning.  A few of the kings decided to meet with Mosyph, not to bargain with him but simply as a courtesy.

What ensued was later recounted by Lord Shuddeni:

> "We princes and lords and generals rode out to meet the Soubous upstart in the clear cold night.  Our delegation of ten found only a delegation of two at the appointed place.  Our words of welcome were less than civil, but were returned with perfect civility.  None of us dismounted.  

> It was my first and strangest encounter with the noble King of Soubous. Firstly, because he brought his Queen with him to a parlay of war.  She said nothing, but her presence was felt by all in attendance.  A painter might capture her likeness and make it seem plain, but her intelligence and attentiveness made her beautiful.

> Secondly, he claimed he had no wish to destroy our countries, but wanted to strengthen and preserve them against future adversities.  He spoke at some length, and as he extoled his ideas of a prospoerous nationhood I had something akin to a waking dream of a world under his dominion: a world unassailed by constant war and the primacy of greed for riches and privilege.  Even as I wanted this dream to be real, wanted to make it real with my own hands, I knew it to be futile and naive.  It was the dream of a child.

> Thirdly because he asked for our surrender and, when we refused, apologized for the pain and destruction he must visit upon us.  He further assured us that we could surrender at any time and be assured of fair treatment.  He audaciously gave us instructions for doing so in a way that would be unmistakable to his people.  So ernest-seeming was his concern for our well-being that none of us could help liking the man, though we knew him deluded.

> Lastly, because he turned to his queen and asked her if she was satisfied.  Had he done enough to spare a little of the blood that must be spilled at dawn?  She looked at him with thanks as plain as if she had moved her lips to utter it.  They touched hands briefly, and rode off in silence.  How could any prince, eight weeks away from his own hearth in winter, not feel sorrow that such two good and affectionate people must soon be cruely separated by the sword of war?

> We turned and rode back to camp in our own kind of silence.  I wondered if we had made the right choices that night, and doubted not that my companions were thinking the same.  Had we met a king who conquered for something other than his personal wealth or glory?  What new idea burned inside us none would say aloud; the very notion was too absurd to be allowed.

The allied kings marched on the Soubous at dawn and overran their fortifications with ease.  The encampment was broken, the tents were gone, the palisades abandoned.  Not a single soldier was in sight.  Just as they were begining to wonder where Mosyph might be hiding his fifty thousand soldiers a dread mist fell upon field.  The fog clung to the men like _grosh_ and all who were caught within it were unable to run away.  Something moved within the fog and killed men with ease.  Mosyph had unveiled his war golems for the first time, and the enemy was utterly unprepared.

With the tactical acumen for which he was already famous and an awful new weapon at his disposal, Mosyph broke the allied force.  In the first day alone eight armies surrendered to him after suffering calamitous losses.  The remaining armies, exhausted and afraid, quickly fragmented.  Prince Quadan wrote to his father, "We couldn't kill Mosyph when we were united and had him surrounded on an open plain.  This new situation is black indeed."

The fate of the Lomiyar army bears special mention here.  They sacked the town of Garaus and slaughtered most of the inhabitants there.  King Mosyph was so enraged that, when he caught up with the Lomiyar army he exacted a terrible revenge.  He took hundreds of their bodies and raised their corpses as undead.  These he chained to the outskirts of every town in the region as a graphic warning: a fate worse than death awaits those who prey on the defenseless.  The message was not lost on the alliance forces, nor was it lost on his own people.  

Within two weeks every one of the twenty seven armies was forced to surrender.  That year, another large collection of kingdoms fell to Mosyph, who now called himself Emperor of As-Perod.  It was the first of ten years of war.

# The Ten Year Conquest 

It may seem strange today that a single man was able to conquer all of [As-Perod](As-Perod.html), but Mosyph's task was made far simpler by the constantly warring nations that existed then.  With a multitude of hostile countries unale to form strong aliances, he never faced coherent opposition.  His most pressing challenge was to unite his conquests together quickly.  Without his knack at building functional nations he could not have succeeded.  "War is easy," he famously wrote, "but peace is far harder."
