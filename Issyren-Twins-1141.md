My Darling Girls,

It will be wonderful seeing you, but due to all the excitement our time will not be as productive as I would like. Also there are certain things I will be unable to say in front of Minzerec, who must report everything he hears to his masters in Khum-Khari. There is so much that has been hidden from you for your own protection, and this is as good a time as any to fill in some of the missing pieces of your own stories. But I know your patience for lore is tragically limited, so a few quick practical notes before we delve too deep into history.

First, do not dwell overmuch on the Signs that I will give you. You will see towers and kingdoms and cleft moons everywhere, until your head hurts with frustration. The point of the signs is to tell you when to perform the first part of your task.

When the signs come to pass, one of you must deliver herself into the hands of the enemy, so that the other may escape. The one who escapes must travel to the ruins of the Eastern Bridge in Maedyn (sometimes called Mosyph's Way) and wait there for a stranger to come from across the water, whom she must kill. The captured sister will suffer pain and darkness. The free sister will face a terrible foe.

This is the prophesy that prompted me to take the Oracle's position from him. But now that I am here, I can see no sound alternative but to direct my lovely and exceptional children to the task for which they were bred. To do otherwise is to invite disaster on an unimaginable scale. You have a choice, it is true. But it is not in your natures to stand idly by while others set the world aright. You have your mother and me to blame for that.

Second, you will want to know what to do until the Signs have passed. All teasing about handsome sea-captains and having babies aside, you should do nothing less than what you see most fit. Grow your strength. Develop your resources. Store up favors and good will. A little reading along the way wouldn't go amiss, but I don't need oracular powers to know THAT isn't likely to happen.

Third, your grandfather doesn't have many good years left to him. A visit or two wouldn't be a bad idea. Basil is acquainted with him, although he is unaware of your relation to him.

Which brings us to the topic of your own lost history...

We should begin at the beginning, and that is with your mother Seraphina. During the 1090's the Academy was in political turmoil (the Demon Scare) and I was forced into hiding. The elves, for whom I had done several good turns, were kind enough to shelter me at great risk to themselves. It was while I was in hiding that I met your grandfather, Menash.

Menash was a handsome slightly older man living with the elves, who showed him uncommon deference. Within a few months I worked out that he was a talented seer, one of maybe a half dozen in the entire world, and that he had hidden among elves nearly his whole life, afraid that the Academy might find him and burn the gift out of his mind with the gibbac poison. His fears were not unfounded, either. In return for shelter, Menash put his gift to use for the Elves, helping them to avoid the worst of the Academy's wrath. I can't tell you how many times the Council launched attacks against the elves, only to have their fingers close on empty air.

Of course I found Menash fascinating and immensely attractive, but it took me over a year to get him into my bed. In time we married, had Seraphina, and for a short while I enjoyed an almost normal family. For the only time in my life, I put aside my studies and adventures to be with people I loved. We had a small wadi in the South Desert, a hundred yards of paradise of our very own. But it wasn't meant to last.

In 1097 the Academy Blacksticks found our home and nearly killed us all. Menash took Seraphina and ran while I fought them off, then faked my own death. Our next meeting was to be brief, and the last for many years. He went back to living literally underground, while I took up a disguise and traveled east with little Seraphina on my back.

In Aspera I joined a group of treasure-hunters: your uncles Slick, Jaq, Danbur, and Larshi. Seraphina grew up on the backs of horses and (after age five) her dus "Cuddlums". It was a hard way to grow up for a little girl, always moving around and being exposed to violence at such a tender age. But then again, she was bred from the sternest stuff imaginable. She was loved, taught, and trained by heroes. After several years in Aspera I was able to come out of hiding, then Seraphina and I settled in Ardengard.

It wasn't long before the Academy came calling again. Your mother's innate potential was extraordinary, and there was simply no way the Academy would overlook her. I let them take her for schooling with the understanding that if she ended up in one of their dungeons, I would personally murder every member of the council. And anyway, Seraphina couldn't wait to go. I insisted on having her apprenticeship myself, and by the time she donned her first Arcanist robes she was almost a Magus.
