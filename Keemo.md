=Keemo the Archer= 
Gnome Ranger

Raised up on a farm, the child of slaves, Keemo learned the laws of nature from an old dwarf called Blue Nose. By the time the veil broke, Keemo had already developed his abilities, enlisted the support of many woodland creatures in the surrounding forest, and hatched an escape plan, a good plan, but a plan that would never come to pass.

He hates the humans for what they did to his parents.
