title: Rite of Te
---

Like most powerful divine magic, the Rite of Te is only effective in the hours around the night of the new moon.  The supplicants cleanse themselves the day before by fasting and drinking nothing but a tea made from barley and pure water from the well under the mountain.  On the day of the ceremony they continue to fast and also then cover themselves (even their hair) in pure wet clay mixed with cleansing herbs.  When the clay has dried completely they wash it off in pure rain water.  This process leaves them clean and fragrant.  Scented oil is applied to their hair, and they are dressed in fine white robes made of of hemp fibers.

Thus purified, the supplicants gather at the flat top of Oxhed's keep and wait for the sun to go down.  As the sun passes below the western horizon they begin to sing the old songs.  Between songs the group lays down on their faces towards the west.  They do this, alternately prostating themselves before the setting sun and sitting up to sing or chant, until near midnight.  Their minds and spirits thus filled with spiritual thoughts they descend the spiral staircase of the tower down to its base, and from there they go down into the mountain itself.

Each worshiper takes with him or her a brazier hanging from a chain in which burns a lump of incense made of crushed cypres, frankincense, and hemp seeds.  The braziers swing from side to side as the procession advances, always in a spiral, always down.  The path is a long one, journeying in ever-wider spirals as the path goes deeper in to the rock of the mountain.  It takes over an hour to reach the maze near the heart of the mountain and, once there, another mile of inward-spiraling turns.  Seven rounds in all through the maze, and the company enters the temple of Te.

= Shrine of the Rock =

The inner temple isn't very large: a round room about 25' across and 40' tall.  The center of the room is occupied by a white stone, which stands a little over waist high (for a human) and appears to extend below the floor.  This stone is believed to be part of the goddess herself, slumbering deep in the earth beneath the mountain.

The arched and vaulted ceiling is tiled in lapis lazuli, inliad with stars made of silver.  Lifelike statues of gods great and small line the walls and occupy niches overlooking the central stone.  Their attitude is one of protection.

Another golden spiral is drawn upon the floor of the temple, and this the worshipers walk going seven times around the sacred stone in ever-smaller circles.  Finally, at the end of this journey, all of the supplicants stand before the stone.  Those who are not favored by the goddess find themselves standing on the gold path around the stone, their favored companions walking away from the stone telling them it is time to leave.

= The Favored =

Those who are favored by the Goddess arrive in the sacred grove, and may remain here for up to four hours.  Te is a neutral generative diety and will favor any who observe the rights and is not an enemy of nature.  Those so favored may remain for up to four hours.  They may leave at any time by walking out of the trees.  Deliberations here are blessed by Te, and participants gain a +6 wisdom modifier for as long as they remain.

Rarely, people may receive a gift or a prophesy as they leave the grove.  These are offered to those who are staunch defenders of nature.

As supplicants leave the grove and re-enter the physical world, they find that no time has passed at all.  They walk through the maze and out of the tunnels by the most direct method, which takes less than ten minutes.  Once outside, they break their fast with fruit and bread and a little wine.  

= The Sacred Grove =

Here the favored will find the fathom'd chalice and white-handled knife.  Two pews there are for congress. The tri-faced goddess walks among fourty-seven ancient boles whose branches lift the heavens.  Twelve times twelve hang her exalted fruits from starry bough, which no mortal hand can pluck.
