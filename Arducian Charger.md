==Description==

Arducian chargers are more than just light warhorses: they are exemplars of their kind.  Legend says their grandsires drank from the well of life, and thereby passed increased vigor to subsequent generations.  They are bred only in the area surrounding [[Arducia]], mostly for the royal families and imperial guards.  Although only slightly larger than light warhorses, they are renowned for their frightening strength and seemingly endless stamina.  An Arducian charger is a significantly superior animal compared to most heavy warhorse.  Most Arducians are dappled, while a few are solid colors with socks or star markings.  Black Arducians are exceedingly rare, and can fetch over 1000g.

A warhorse can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

**Carrying Capacity:** A light load for an Arducian warhorse is up to 400 pounds; a medium load, up to 800 pounds; and a heavy load, up to 1200 pounds. A light warhorse can drag 5,175 pounds.

**Tricks Known:** An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel.  Because of the extraordinary intelligence of these animals, they can learn one additional trick.

==Feats==

**Endurance** Mounts gain a +4 bonus on the following checks and saves: Swim checks made to resist nonlethal damage, Constitution checks made to continue running, Constitution checks made to avoid nonlethal damage from a forced march, Constitution checks made to hold your breath, Constitution checks made to avoid nonlethal damage from starvation or thirst, Fortitude saves made to avoid nonlethal damage from hot or cold environments, and Fortitude saves made to resist damage from suffocation. Also, you may sleep in light or medium armor without becoming fatigued.

**Run** When running, mounts move five times your normal speed (300' if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or four times your speed (240' if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load). If mounts make a jump after a running start (see the Jump skill description), you gain a +4 bonus on your Jump check. While running, chargers retain their Dexterity bonus to AC.

**Overrun:** These mounts have the Overrun feat, meaning riders may trample targets as if they had the Trample feat.  Arducian chargers gain +17 on their strength checks during an overrun attempt (+5 str, +4 size, +4 stability, +4 feat).  This does not stack with a rider's Trample feat.

==Overland Movement==

Chargers travel at 6 miles per hour with a light load, or 48 miles a day.

Traveling farther in a day requires a forced march.  Each additional hour of marching causes 1d6 of non-lethal damage plus fatigue.  If a charger is being used as a mount, then the damage is lethal.  A constitution check (DC 10, +2 per extra hour) avoids both the damage and the fatigue.  Healing the damage also removes the fatigue.

Because of their extraordinary constitution, Arducians have a +10 bonus (+6 con, +4 endurance) on their checks to avoid damage and fatigue from a forced march.  It is pretty safe to force march them for at least a couple of hours.
