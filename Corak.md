# Overview

The Dutchy of Corak covers the southern third of Aspera.  It includes the Silver Hills, the Coldmyr Frontier, the southern river valley, and the southern tip of Angsul Forest.  Virtually all of the country's copper, silver, and platinum comes from the mines in the Silver Hills.

The main bastion of Corak is called the [Sauvine](Sauvine.html), a massive finger of rock sloping up from the terrain.  A city of over 20,000 lies sprawled on this rock and the surrounding terrain.  The upper city, which lies on the Sauvine proper, is segmented by high walls, which require invaders to breach multiple fortifications to take the city.  At the highest tip stands a magnificent palace, featuring a silver dome that can be seen for many miles around.  Although not as ancient as [Oxhed](Oxhed.html), it is the most grand set of fortifications in the kingdom.  This city has never been taken by force of arms.  The "lower city", located around the [Sauvine](Sauvine.html), is often cloaked in a blue haze from the smeltworks.

# History

In the days before [Samit](Samit.html), Corak was a powerful city-state.  It agreed to the union with [Oxhed](Oxhed.html), [Newholy](Newholy.html), [Maedyn](Maedyn.html), and Stamhead out of a need for mutual protection.  It was independent again during the civil war (c.1000CE) until [Tygar](Tygar.html) reunited the kingdom.

# The Harrell Family

The Duke's family would be powerful even if they didn't hold title here.  They have long-standing contracts with the Throne to operate several rich mines and a smelting operation.  In addition, family members own several profitable enterprises in their own right.  An [abbreviated family tree](http://as-perod.wikispaces.com/file/view/Harrel-graph-2.gif.html) of the living Harrells and their relationship to the sisters of Ardengard is available.

The family proudly traces its lineage to [Samit](Samit.html), [Mosyph](Mosyph.html), and [Tygar](Tygar.html).  Further, the Harrells are related by blood and marriage to most of the royal families of [Soubous](Soubous.html).

## Duke Fredrick of Corak

The current Duke, Fredrick of Corak, is best known for expanding the dutchy's mining operations and dealing harshly with anything that interferes with the flow of bullion.  While some people complain that he cares little for the people in his charge, nobody can deny that the business of the duchy is well-run.

Fredrick is married to Noora, a princess of [Voronia](Voronia.html) (a principality of [Soubous](Soubous.html)).

## Old Ludo Harrell

The Duke's father, sometimes called the "Old Duke" or "Old Ludo", is a very elderly man of great distinction.  He was a Rider for over two decades before taking the seat, and only gave it up in favor of his son when the infirmities of age made the rigors of administration difficult.  He now spends much of his time reading, tutoring his several grandchildren, and napping in the palace gardens.

People sometimes appeal to Ludo when they feel slighted by the judicial system, but Ludo nearly always defers to his son Fredrick.

Old Ludo had a younger brother, Fadyn, of whom he was very fond.  But Fadyn died at age 12, in a goblin invasion.  Many people credit that fact as the driving force behind Ludo's relentless campaign against goblins in the Silver Hills.

Ludo has five children.  His oldest son Fredrick (the current Duke), daughters Ester and Margorie, son Seywold, and Ludo (often called Ludo the Youngest).

## Seywold

Prince Seywold administers most of the defense and judicial affairs of the duchy for his brother the Duke.  The "Duke's men", as Seywold's garrison is known, are generally feared and have a reputation for callousness.  The courts are harsh, and biased against the poor, but are free of outright corruption.

Seywold and his wife Therese have one son and a daughter [Calanth](Calanth.html).

## Margorie, Countess of the Sauvine

The city of Corak and all the land around the Sauvine is managed by Old Ludo's daughter Margorie.  The title of Count was originally bestowed upon her husband Hector (younger brother to Count Jaq of [Reeland](Reeland.html)) who managed the city well for many years.  When Hector was killed in a stunningly public assassination the denizens of the city clamored for her to take his place.  She continues to be popular with most of the groups in the city, although there is some friction between her and Seywold.
