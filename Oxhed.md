title: Oxhed
---

Oxhed is a very large mountain on the east bank of the river [Yeron](Yeron.html).  The ground in a 10 mile radius rises gently up from the floodplain, throwing long spurs out to the south and east.  The presences of the mountain forces the river to flow northwest then double back to the southeast before resuming its regular northerly direction.  

The river flows fast and deep around the mountain, cutting a deep channel.  Grain is not grown here, but the approach from the south is good grazing lands, which people use for llamas, goats, and a small number of cattle.  On the mountain itself people grow grapes on terraced slopes that face north and west, while large stands of trees cover most of the rest.  The town of Highbough is sprawled at the crest of the southern spur.

The mountain is capped by a outcropping of hard stone thrust up from deep in the earth.  This stone has been shapped and terraced until it looks like a giant pedestal, on which sits the keep built by Belad, the first king of [Aspera](Aspera.html), and his successors.  Belad's Keep was was the crown seat until court grew larger than the castle, forcing a move to the trade city [Maedyn](Maedyn.html).  Although the king no longer resides here, Oxhed boasts the most heavily fortified keep in Aspera.

# Leadership 

Heirophant Danburr is the top religious official in Aspera, and also the Duke of Oxhed.
High Justicar Clausen also makes his home here.

# The Wall 

The only good approach to the keep is by a road that climbs the pedestal in several switchbacks, ending in a large wide space before the gates.  The gates themselves are thick darkwood bound in adamantium.  The walls are built out of stone cut from the hard pedestal, thirty feet thick and fifty feet high.  Eighty-foot-high towers grace each of the four corners and flank the gates.  The wall is nearly square, about 500 yards per side.

the outter court houses  the stables, blacksmith, barracks, and defensive weaponry.  

# The Castle 

The castle takes up a third of the fort, centered on the northwest corner.  It contains quarters for the nobles, a grand ball room, a throne room, and other spaces you would expect to find in a royal home.  The castle is a large rectangle with an open courtyard in the center.  Rising from the green courtyard is a very tall tower.  The stones are closely fitted and impressively smooth.  The tower walls make up the bulk of its volume, making the whole thing nearly solid.  The top is graced with 15' tall effigies of four celestials looking outward.  The surface at the top is quite flat.

Beneath the tower is a tunnel that leads down to the caves.  Carved into the living rock is a vast network of tunnels in which is stored vast amounts of food (mostly grains), wine, preserved fruits and meats, weapons.  There is a treasury here too, if one knows the way, and a well dug at roughly river level.  These chambers are segmented by very thick iron doors positioned in a way that makes them immune to large battering rams.

= The Underchappel = 

Deep in the mountain, only a hundred or so feet above the level of the river, is a chamber known mainly by the sacred teachers and the high priest.  The chamber is approached by a netowrk or corridors that, at first, may appear to be a maze.  By following the thin gold line that runs along the floor, the correct turns may be followed, which flows towards the center in a spiral.  The total trip is over one mile long.

The inner chamber is quite high, vaulted and domed, tiled in lapis lazuli and adorned with stars worked in mithril.  PCs with a little training in Arcane, Religion, Navigation, or Survival can easily identify the constellations (DC 5).  At the four cardinal points are large alabaster  statues of Pelor, Corellon, Moradin, and Yondalla.  At the center of the room stands a starkly white stone.  It has never been carved, but the dwarves who originally found this place carefully removed all traces of regular stone over a period of many years until only the strange white rocck remained.  It seems to be a pillar rising 30 feet from the floor, slightly tapered at the top.  The pillar descends below into the earth, and the floor around it is covered in gold and inscribed with pictograms.  Any of the sacred teachers can relate the stories written here.  The most prominent of these is the [Te and the Formation of As-Perod](Te and the Formation of As-Perod.html).

To experience the full effect of the chappel, one must walk the line at the divine hour in the [Rite of Te](Rite of Te.html).
