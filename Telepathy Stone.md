This spell creates two or more stones that can be used to communicate by telepathy for one minute per day per caster level.  Once made, the stones comprise a unique set.  Any one of them may be used to communicate with the holder of any one of the other stones from the same set, or all of them at once.  To be effective, a telepathy stone must be held or worn on the person using it.  The per-day duration limit is one minute per caster level for each stone.  A stone user does not have to use up all the time at once.

A set of stones is always cut from the same, flawless [[protean quartz]] crystal.  The value of the initial crystal must be at least the square of the number of stones desired times 100gp.  (eg: a set of two stones requires a 400gp crystal, a set of three stones 900gp, a set of four 1600gp.)  Dividing the crystal properly into equal parts requires a craft(gemcutter) skill, one hour, and a check of (DC 15 + 2 per stone).

//Dispel Magic// can remove the spell from a stone.  If a stone is cracked or cleaved then the magic is dispelled.  Minor scratches do not dispell the magic.  If the magic on one stone is dispelled, the other stones are unaffected.  To re-enchant a stone the spell must be cast again on all of the stones of the original set.

//Material Component:// A flawless [[protean quartz]] crystal, evenly split into the number of stones desired.
