title: Ritual Magic
---

Wizards can work more powerful magic if they cooperate. This does not require any special feats, but it does require a special formulation of the spell. Spells of up to four level higher than what a caster can normally perform can be cast provided they posses enough friends and the appropriate spells. It will also take longer to cast, and requires drawing a magic circle (DC 20). The rules for drawing the circle are the same as for circles of protection, although the actual diagram is different.

|| **Spell Level** || **Number of Casters** || **Casting Time** ||
|| +1 || 3 || 1 min ||
|| +2 || 6 || 10 min ||
|| +3 || 9 || 1 hour ||
|| +4 || 12 || 12 hours ||


For example, Jojo the second-level wizard wants to cast Fireball, a third level spell. The spell is two levels higher than he can normally cast, so he needs a total of six people to cast it, a version of the spell that has been divided into six parts, and ten minutes to cast it. Probably not very useful in combat, but hugely satisfying.

A ritual spell is really a group of different spells that must be cast simultaneously. Each part of the spell is different and requires it's own space in the spellbook. Each wizard participating in the casting must prepare a different part of the spell.

In the case of Jojo's Fireball spell, he will need to copy six first-level spells into his spellbook. In the most extreem case, a ninth-level spell formulated as twelve fifth-level spells would require no less than sixty pages in a spell book. Book suppliers to high-level wizards commonly provide blank spellbooks with 60 pages for exactly this purpose.

Researching ritual spells is similarly compounded. If Jojo invents the "fireball for six novice wizards" himself, he will need to successfully research six first-level spells. This is aguably the most difficult aspect of ritual magic.
