## Overview 

E'Shyris is the ancestral nation of the dwarves, although you might never know it simply by crossing over the land by foot.  Most of the nation lives underground in cities carved deep into the living rock, or in towns aboveground that merge gracefully with the mountains on which they perch.

A few of the more visible dwarven works are stunning:  At Stavengar Strait is a massive lighthouse, over five hundred feet high, with a lamp that seems as bright as the sun;  Across the Lamwen Gorge is a bridge spanning nearly a mile, wide enough for four wagons to cross abreast;  The Anakra, the four giant statues as large as mountains, face west over the ocean.  These great works are unrivaled for their sheer size and audacity by anything else in As-Perod.

Underground, the sights aren't any less awesome.  There is the Bantaa, large enough to hold ten thousand dwarves, where the epic choruses of the Old-Fathers are sung.  In the highest caverns, just under the snowy peaks of the Longhort, lie the sprawling Gardens of Light, which are illuminated by massive windows built into the mountain peaks.  In the now-dead volcanic heart of the mountains lies the First Forge, where only the greatest of smiths are permitted to work their craft.  These and many other marvels await travelers, who return from the Inner Realm at a loss for words to describe what they see there.  

## Geography 

The northern tip of E'Shyris is marked by the Stavengar, and the massive lighthouse that overlooks it.  Going south from there you can follow the Longhort Range of mountains until you reach the deep sea inlets.  The second of these, the Tanestpoling Inlet, marks the southern boundary of E'Shyris.  The eastern border is irregular, extending to the last peaks (or the first if you are heading west) that are covered with snow year-round.

The west slopes of the Longhort descend suddenly to nearly sea level, creating a narrow plain a score miles wide that marks the west end of the continent and the western boundary of E'Shyris.  This long then stretch of land, called Westshore, is as dry and desolate as any inland desert.  The ocean currents turn rainfall away from the coastline in most years, and the dramatic rise of the Longhort prevents weather from crossing from the east side of the mountain range.  A few rivers have carved their way down from the mountaintops to the shore in channels that delineate the sum total of all the arable land in Westshore, and even this little bit of water tends to dry up completely in the summer.

## Government 

The dwarven nation is ruled by a system of laws given to the first of their people long before the dawn of the human Empire.  All dwarves can trace their family history back five thousand years, to when their people were first organized into tribes.  The history of E'Shyris goes back even farther than that, graphically depicted by the statues that line the royal boulevard depicting every head of state for ten thousand years.  Presiding over them all is a giant image of Moradin in burnished gold.

### The Old Rule 

At one time, the nation was ruled by the priestly class, which drew its members from the best and brightest in the realm.  These people dedicated themselves to the orderly administration of the realm, and took vows of austerity to reduce conflicts of interest.  The members of this class were carefully ranked by seniority and proven ability, and the greatest among them was chosen during a ceremony to serve as the Heirophant.

Religious observance among dwarves is still mandatory within the realm.  This includes prayers twice daily, ritual washing at meals, prohibitions against touching the dead, attendance at important rituals, dietary restrictions, and the like.  Allowances are made for foreigners, provided they do not interfere with observance by others.

### The New Rule 

Since the Veil the number of Dwarven women has decreased to about one in twelve.  When it became clear that the future of the dwarven race was at stake, the Heirophant decreed that ever female had to bear thirteen children -- each by a different male.  As demands on the females to reproduce grew, the women used their position to acquire more power than they had had in the past.  Although they had always been active in the priestly caste, they now make up the large majority of the priesthood.

Women now hold most of the power in E'Shyris, having expanded their religious role and their administrative roles.  The family shrines are controlled by the matriarchs, who decide which men will be given children (and how much they will pay).

### Dwarven Law 

Laws are ancient and tend towards being inflexible, but justice is fair to a fault.  Trials are decided by a professional jury, which are allowed to ask questions and challenge testimony.  The judges at such trials specialize in both law and religion -- it is a rather exalted position.

Punishments include fines, imprisonment, exile, and death.

### Administration 

Clans serve both as a way to delineate ancestry and as an administrative division of the population.  In the past, when a clan got too large some section of it was carved out and made into a new clan.  In the last several hundred years quite a few clans have died out completely while other clans have been re-merged.  The pressures of a shrinking population have pushed clan rivalries to an all-time low.

## Culture 

The dwarven talents for mining, masonry, and metalworking are well-known.  But there is one dwarven art form that can only be experienced in the Inner Realm: that of the choir.  Public spaces are designed to enhance dwarven voices in song, down to the rumbling sub-bass that has been known to crack stone.

Skill with tools is highly prized, and many dwarves travel far and wide for opportunities to hone their skills and gain breadth of experience.  Almost any major construction project world-wide will have a significant contingent of dwarves working on it.  Ultimately, all of this experience comes back to E'Shyris.  A dwarf that wants to be recognized as a master in his field must create a great signature work, one that melds great skill and his wide experience.  Often this work is displayed prominently in his home or shop, and comes to define him.

### Children and Parenthood 

Clan matriarchs, together with other women of a clan, decide which men will have children with which women.  Men pay handsomely for the priviledge of fathering a child, either in gold or in services to the mother's house.  Children are raised for at least several years in their mother's house.  If a father needs to move abroad or live away from his clan, he will take his child with him if the child is old enough.  For as long as a child continues to live in his mother's house, his father contributes to the upkeep of the household in some substantial way.  Girl children never leave E'Shyris, as they are too precious.

People identify by their mothers' house, and even while living abroad will keep tabs on major changes in the family structure, especially the birth of any girls.  All dwarven men living abroad are expected to make the pilgrimage to their mother's house, in hopes of gaining the right to father a child.

Men who are especially desirable, either by their looks or their considerable talents, may be "traded" with another clan for an equally suitable male.  Men are expected to agree to these arrangements, or be cut off from any further chance for children.
