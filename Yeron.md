title: The Yeron
---

The Yeron, aka Great River, forms the eastern boundary of [As-Perod](As-Perod.html).  It separates As-Perod (the Third Creation), from [Gon-Perod](Gon-Perod.html) (the Second Creation).  No one in living memory has crossed the river, and there are mists that continually obscure the eastern shore.  Rumor has it that sometimes the mists part, and a deep forest can be glimpsed on the far shore.  The river is believed to be an average of 1.5 miles wide in its wider spans.  

Its source lies in the frozen mountains of the south which shed their water into Calulash Basin.  When full, the Calulash is a sea in its own right at over 300 miles across and several hundred feet deep.  Few men have visited the basin, due to the inhospitable climate and the [Goblin Dominion](Goblin Dominion.html) which occupies much of the surrounding mountains..  The basin is the source of several rivers, of which the Yeron is the most prominent.  The Yeron is fed by numerious tributaries on its 3,500 mile journey through the nations of [Aspera](Aspera.html), and [Ild-Eldir](Ild-Eldir.html).

The river is at its highest during the spring and early summer because of rains and the melting snows in the south.  The annual flooding creates a vast alluvial plain which shelters millions of people.  The mouth of the river is the Arulira delta, a shifting network of flats, lakes, tributaries, and tidal marshes hundreds of miles wide thats let out into the north sea.
