title: Lady Calanth
---

 The Lady Calanth is the only daughter of Dabius Harrell, son of Ludo Harrell.  Dabius' oldest brother Fredrick is the Duke of [[Corak]].  As one of only three living daughters of Ludo's line, she was given in an important diplomatic marriage at age 14 to Prince Shian of far-away Ustolia (a principality of Soubous).  He turned out to be a terrible husband.

A few years after her marriage, the people of Ustolia revolted and deposed their prince in favor of a very young cousin, with the revolutionary leader as "regent".  Nearly all of the Prince's family ended up with their heads on pikes, and Lady Calanth only escaped through the pity of her chambermaids.  She found shelter with relatives in a nearby principality, but soon set out for the long journey home.

Instead of the relieved homecoming she had hoped for, her family was cool to her.  She had failed to produce an heir, the only service her family required of her.  She was sent to live in relative seclusion at an old family estate called //Nearshore//.
