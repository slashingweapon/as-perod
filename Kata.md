Kata follows her heart and Mother Earth. She believes the best way to connect with Mother Earth is through the star chakra which is located underground, below the feet. It brings awareness every time you need emotional stability and grounding. This is why its natural and right for gnomes to love living in burrows.

==Every day is Earth day to Kata!== 

Kata loves new age music, patchouli, beads, wearing leather, eating freshly hunted meat and flowers.
