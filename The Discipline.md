title: The Discipline
---

**The Discipline** is the code by which [Arcane Academy](Arcane Academy.html) members must abide.  In a nutshell, it demands that arcanists place the Academy's priorities ahead of any other loyalties, must register their magical items, won't engage in certain research, and will surrender contraband items to the Academy.

== The Oath ==

> I *name* swear to use my gifts and lore in the service of As-Perod for the protection and improvement of all its people.  I swear this oath to my arcane brothers, who have first claim on my allegiance before race, nation, or family.  I bow before the Council of Mage Lords whose wisdom informs my actions.  I bind myself to the arcane law, for as long as I shall live.

== The Arcane Law ==

This is just a partial outline.  The actual code is quite long, and subject to revision by the Mage Lords.
