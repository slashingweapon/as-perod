= Geography =

The Dutchy of Newholy includes the counties of [[Turyr]] and [[Rotherford]], which are in the Angsul Forest, and the county of [[Forsooth]], which is a farming county on the Yeron.  

The Angsul forest is several rows of hills covered by dense forest, with inhabitable valleys in between.  The tallest hills are those of the Panginia Ridge, which runs in a line pointing northwest and separates the Rotherford and Turyr counties.  Rotherford lies in the Kirmor valley on the south side of the ridge, while Turyr lies on the northern Mersey valley.  Each valley produces an eponymous river, both of which merge at [[Newholy(City)|the city of Newholy]] and from there flows to the [[Yeron]].

= Governance =

Like most of Aspera, the dutchy of Newholy is a mixed government.  Titled nobles receive their positions from the monarch and oversee the governance of their various realms.  Towns are run by mayors appointed by their barons, often with the approval of the citizens.  The nobles oversee matters of governance but leave many of the day-to-day details to the appointed citizens.

== Duke Endethel ==

[[perod-secrets:Endethel|Duke Endethel]] is a nobleman of the traditional Asperan mode: a fourth-generation Rider and a lifelong defender of the realm whose ancestors aided Tygar in the reformation of Aspera in 1054.  He has open hopes of leaving the Dutchy to his son Prince Jamyt.  He has delegated the management of the city entirely to his son over a decade ago (giving him the title Baron of the City of Newholy), and leaves Jamyt in charge of the whole Dutchy when he is away.

Endethel is a graying man in his sixties, but still in fair health.

== Prince Jamyt ==

[[perod-secrets:Jamyt|Prince Jamyt]] is the eldest son of Duke Endethel, and widely expected to take up his father's position when Endethel dies or steps down.  This may be the motivation behind his extensive renovations to the city and the several conspicuous statues of the royal family and other important figures of the kingdom.  His rennovations have often been painful, especially for the poorer classes, but nobody can argue that they haven't had a dramatic effect.  What was once a shrinking, decaying industrial city has turned into the thriving cultural center of Aspera.  The prince is married to an [[Eboa|Eboan]] woman, Princess Saharta.

The Prince is in his early fourties.

== Princess Saharta ==

[[perod-secrets:Saharta|Princess Saharta]] is a princess twice over and a baroness.  She is a princess of [[Eboa]] in her own right, being the second daughter of the Sultan and a niece of the Grand Prince of Soubous [[Djazsef]], several times removed.  She is a direct descendant of the First Emperor [[Mosyph]].  She holds the title of princess of Newholy from her marriage to Jamyt, and also the title of Baronett of the City.  She was married to the Prince when she was fifteen and he was twenty five in an arrangement made by her father.

Saharta has little interest in affairs of state, but maintains an intense social schedule.  Her life revolves around social events and her horses.  She is a great lover of horses and owns a breeding farm which she has stocked with some of the finest animals from her homeland.  She can trace the lineage of her horses as far back as her own, and runs them in all of the stadium races.

The Princess is infamous for following her native practice of covering most of her face and hair, even in the presence of the King.  Only her eyes are usually exposed, though most people believe her to be beautiful because of her youthful vigour.  She is equally infamous for her expensive taste for imported cloth, which has influenced the style of dress in the city.

== Princess Jiskira ==

[[perod-secrets:Jiskira|Princess Jiskira]] is the only daughter of the Duke.  She has trained as a Rider, but her father the Duke would not allow her to take the thane's oath.  She is often seen sparring against riders or touring the dutchy with a few handpicked guards.  She is considered reckless by the people who are in charge of her safety, but admired by the common folk with whom she is unafraid to mingle.

She is a few years younger than her brother, and known for her light touch in affairs of state.  Matters too trivial for the Prince or the Duke to handle that nonetheless require noble intervention are often presented to her.  Although only nominally involved in governance she is believed to be well-informed.
