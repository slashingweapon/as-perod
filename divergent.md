title: Divergence
---

"Divergent" is a word often used by the Academy to describe:

# someone of extraordinary talent or 
# someone posessing unique and dangerous powers. 

The most famous divergents would have to be the two great emperors of As-Perod.  [[Mosyph]] was divergent in the first sense of the word, being naturally endowed with talents in many fields. His grandson [[Sidir]] was also divergent in the second sense, having demonstrated an ability to call outsiders at a very young age.
