=Ellewaith of Mallowbridge=

Ellewaith was born in the first century an unwanted daughter of a prostitute and an imperial soldier.  The utter lowness of her birth would have condemned her to a life of penury or crime but for her uncommon mental aptitudes.  Her local priest agreed to teach her, and for a while Ellewaith distinguished herself as a student of the divinities.

In her teen years she grew dissatisfied with religious studies and devoted herself entirely to the aid of "unwanted girls".  Her first several miracles all involved healing poor children, mostly orphans, and occasionally punishing those who persecuted them.  During the course of her life she built and funded dozens of small local institutions to promote the care and education of poor children, mostly girls.

Ellewaith was captured and condemned to death by Emperor Sidir's Loyalty Brigade, but the execution never took place.  As the headsman raised his axe to take her head a blinding light shot down from the sky and blinded the spectators.  When the crowd's vision cleared it discovered her shackles empty and the esteemed woman missing.  She was never again seen in human form, but she began to appear in visions across the country.

==Sainthood==

Because of her numerous good deeds in this life and miraculous departure for the next, Ellewaith was declared a saint by the Heirophant.  As the faithful began to offer prayers in her name some of her most ardent worshipers received divine magic to continue her work.

Community, Divination, Liberation

Saint Ellewaith is best known as the patron of lost and unwanted girls and community organizations.  Less well-known is her connection to divination.

=The Waifwrights=

The Waifwrights, more formally known as the Sisters of Saint Ellewaith, continues the work of their patron saint.  They have small chapters in every major city dedicated to the care and education of unwanted girls, and attempt to find them all apprenticeships or a place in the order itself.  Especially bright or dedicated girls might be sent to the Waifwright monastery in [[Oxhed]] to be specially trained in divinities and other studies.  Girls who receive this more intensive education often find husbands in lower levels of government (several are married to Barons) or become tutors to the children of the higher nobility.

A little-known position among the Waifwrights is the Oracle of Te.  During the [[Rite of Te]] the holder of this post will enter the inner temple and be imbued with the oracular presence while the passage between worlds is open.  When the Oracle dies the search for a replacement can take sometimes take years.  Every month, promising Waifwrights are brought into the inner sanctuary to see if any are given the divine presence.  This process continues each month with different supplicants until a new oracle is found.
