Winter 1131

//It has taken me eleven years and some great expense to find this place.  Imagine my surprise at finding one of these "rifts" so rediculously close to home and with an old house on top of it.  Maybe luck is the wrong word for it.  Someone in the distant past must have found it and built this as a place of secret power.  They are gone now, but some of their good work remains.  It makes me wonder how many more places like this exist.  Are they everywhere, and just require the knowledge to find them?//

----

// After a closer look I realize I will have to restore the building before it is habitable.  The secret door is still well-concealed and works smoothly, no doubt built by someone who knew the dwarvish craft.  The foundation and outer walls of the house are likewise standing strong, but everything else must be rebuilt.  I will tell my father that it is to be a hunting lodge, and I'll even bring guests here.  Nobody will be the wiser about the true purpose of the place.//

----

//I watched the blackness spread tonight, a hole in space.  I dared not go in or speak to whatever lay beyond because I am unprepared.  I admit I was afraid, and ran from the summoning room.  I'm going to need to be careful.  I need some arcane help.  I doubt that I can prevail on my cousin to lend me his arcanist ... I'll have to find my own.//

----
Autumn 1131

//Construction has finally begun.  It will at least be decent shelter when it is finished, maybe a little more.  I have things and workers delivered from Thrace so few poeple around here knows where the cabin is.  My biggest problem is getting some magical help.//

----

//Jererack's new apprentice was easy to lure here and hold captive.  Young women are so easy.  She will repair the magic circle for me, and assist with the other preparations.  She tells me there are already powerful enchantments in place, but the glyphs and wards must be renewed and the circle has to be repaired and refined.  She briefly refused to help, but she isn't very resistant to pain.  I have appointed Fashrin to keep watch over her.//

//Fashrin was a lucky find.  He is willing to commit violence but doesn't wallow in it.//

----

//We watched the rift open together tonight, and the minor fixes made so far have had an effect.  A magical barrier appeared at the appointed hour and the glyphs lit up and consumed much of the material.  The warding paste I had to buy from Newholy were expensive, but it looks to be worth it.//

----

Winter 1132

//I am astonished.  The rift works exactly as described by Janicus, appearing during the three hours of midnight on the new moon.  I journeyed into the realm of shadow, and when the appointed hours had passed I was thrust back into my own world.  Few have done what I have accomplished.  Certainly, nobody outside the Academy.//

//In this shadow realm there are people who look and act like us, but according to Janicus they have much more power.  There is a town very near the rift, hidden by a house just like the one in my world.  Maybe I can find an arcanist in the shadow town who will give me the help I need.  I think the next step is far beyond a mere apprentice's ability.//

----

//The arcanists of this shadow realm are definitely powerful, yet are as ignorant of my world as I am of theirs.  I obviously stand out, and much in this place is vaguely familiar in an unsettling way.  But I have bartered with a shadow wizard to make bell of summoning for me.  That it only needed to work one day out of the month reduced the cost considerably, so he says.  But it still cost me dearly.  It will of course only work in those hours when the veil is weakest, but that is often enough.//

//Apprentice Carla is getting harder to manage.  I am giving Fashrin free reign to control her more forcefully provided she remain capable of performing her duties.  Soon I will no longer need her.//

----

Spring 1132

//The summoning has worked perfectly.  The demon took an alluring form and tempted me, then threatened me, then tried to bribe me with money I doubt she indeed has.  What I want from her is knowledge.  I sent her away.  I will have to consider how to proceed.//

----

//After three summonings, the demon Khelekza and I have left aside the threats and demands for the time being, and now we talk at length.  She is deeply interested in our world, since it has been separated from the multiverse for so long.  I am as curious about other words as she is about mine.  This gives us much to talk about during our few hours together.

I have learned so much from her already.//

----

Summer 1132

//Khelekza has agreed to teach me the ways of power, but I must first perform two services.  First I must show my commitment by becoming baron.  The quickest way to do that is to kill my father.  I will blame it on the elves.

The second thing to be done is give her a living sacrifice.  Carla has become more trouble than she is worth anyway.//

----

//It was all so easy, once the plan was made.  Iaden and her elf-loving friends are the only ones who suspect anything, and they are out of power since Andronicus died.  I will be baron, and there is nothing they can do about it.

Khelekza ate Carla's beating heart in front of me.  I felt that I would be sick, but she has shown me the truth of things.  Power goes to those willing to sacrifice others to get it.//

----

Autumn 1132

//Khelekza, with help from mages from the shadowland, has been researching ways to stay in our world beyond those few hours each month when the veil is weak.  No luck so far.

It might be a while until my next entry.  Management of the Barony is taking up my time, and I have to make the trip to Maedyn to petition the king for permanent status.//

----

Spring 1133

//Finally, I can resume my research.  I have my title and things are under control in the township, so nobody will miss me for a few days a month.  Khelekza pretends to be put out that I haven't contacted her for so long, which is funny coming from someone I know would eat my heart if it suited her purposes.//

----

//We have a solution.  Some demons can possess a person or object.  A sufficiently skilled mind can hide within such a vessel indefinitely.  We plan to experiment next month.  We are quite excited.//

----

//Success!  Five demons have possessed various small precious articles, and some can even give the items magicl power as if they were enchanted.  I will give these things away to people who will no doubt carry them around for the benefits the trinkets impart.  In a month the demons will possess their bearers, sometime during the hours when they won't be immediately ejected from our world.  To leave their host objects at any other time is to be banished.

I will propose to Iaden and give her the necklace for our engagement.  A dirt-born wench like her wouldn't refuse a Baron's proposal.  Her tragic, and I hope messy, death will bring me some peace.//

----

Summer 1133

//They're calling it "The Madness of Thrace".  Five people there apparently went insane all on the same night and committed atrocities.  Two of them died.  Such an unholy bloody mess.  Khelekza's friends have even more of a thirst for blood than I realized.  I doubt the attacks will be linked to the jewelry, or that the jewelry will be linked to me, but still I am worried.  On the plus side, I won't have to pay Cleodites the money I owe him.  He killed his only heirs before doing himself.

My only regret is that Iaden wasn't one of my victims.  She refused my proposal again.  Also, she avoids me entirely now.  Like a girl of her birth couldn't benefit from association with a nobleman.  At least I don't have to put up with her constant petitions.//

----

//Jererack tells me the Academy is investigating the Madness.  We won't be using the portal again until I hear they have left.  It could be months.//

----

Winter 1134

//Jererack has left for KhumKhari, a long journey.  He hinted that senior wizards have been called from all over As-Perod to participate in some kind of massive magical work.  Khelekza thinks they are trying to strengthen the veil, but that it will be beyond them.  The Academy is too weakened by the veil to have much effect on it, or so her thinking goes.//

----

Spring 1134

//The portal does not open.  I can not summon Khelekza or her minions with the bell.  The Academy must have succeeded.  

But if I understand Hero Janicus rightly, it can't last.  Energies from the other planes is what gives our world its vitality, which in turn is what powers the veil.  They are simply chocking off the veil from its own source of power.  

It could be months, even years, before the shadow portal opens again.  My maths aren't good enough to do the computations.//

----

Autumn 1138

//There is a glimmer from the portal.  I almost didn't check on it, but here it is showing signs of coming back.  I have loaded the wards, in case something tries to come through when I'm not looking -- always a posibility when you start inviting things into your house.

Also, I am reopening the house for Orodriel.  She has no idea that I killed her mother to give her the powers that are only just now begining to develop.  She thinks I'm just some distant relation.  I am her only benefactor, other than the woman whom I have paid to raise her and who treats her with such indifference  Her guardian will die soon, leaving Ora alone and friendless in the world.  I will be there to pick up the pieces and give her a future.//

----

Winter 1139

//Orodriel has come to live at the lodge, and I have hired a teacher for her.  They will live here quite comfortably through the winter, and Fashrin will check in on them from time to time.  I keep my own identity a secret for now.

The portal still isn't fully working.

The king has appointed an auditor because of the shortfall in taxes.  The farmers are too stuipd to make a living on their own, them blame me for how poor their vines are, or that there's nobody to harvest them.  As if they couldn't just hire some poor hands from Turyr or Newholy or Thrace to replace the elves.  This guy Fealous is humorless, and isn't tempted by girls or wine or even money.  At least with the elves gone I don't have to put up with their singing half the year.//

----

Spring 1139

//The portal is back open, finally!  I have missed Khelekza's advice and her news of far far away places.  It is the only really interesting thing to look forward to.  If I have to spend one more month shut up with Fealous and the accounts, I am going to make him swollow his ink bottle.

We had a lot of catching up to do, but we didn't have enough time.  She got banished after less than an hour.//

----

//The portal was open again this month.  Khelekza and spent most of our time figuring out what to do about this auditor and about Iaden.  The two of them together are becoming a major nuisance.  It doesn't help that her's is one of the few thriving plots of land.  I tried disrupting her operations, but she must have some kind of protection.  She seems to avert every disaster I set up for her.

Orodriel progresses well.  Already her reading and bearing are much improved.  She has also taken me into her confidence regarding her powers over the dead, not realizing it is I who is most responsible for them.  I have encouraged her to experiment on animals and such to find out just what she can do.  I dare not show her the book.//

----

Summer 1139

//Khelekza recommends I marry Iaden, co-opting her ability and reputation while at the same time showing Fealous that I'm willing to do anything to put the barony to rights.  She gets to manage the barony affairs under my seal, which will put much of the blame on her if she doesn't succeed.  If she becomes too much a nuisance I can have Fashrin dispose of her.

It may take a little time, but if I can have her wed before the end of the summer then I can concentrate on my portal and on getting closer to cousin Jamyt.  His ambition is begining to pay off.//

----

//I consumated my marriage with Iaden then rushed here to enjoy some solitude.  I honestly can't stand the woman, who insists on being heard and seen wherever she goes.  At least I won't have to be in this pitiful town more than one season a year now that she governs under my seal.  I have co-opted my enemy, but I won't enjoy having her under foot.  As part of our agreement Avadur is forced to leave the barony -- they are far too close for my comfort.

When I told Khelekza that the deed was done she consoled me in a way I didn't expect.  The frigid peasant girl pales in comparison to a being with hundreds of years of experience and an otherworldly body to draw on.//

----

Spring 1140

//I have allowed Khelekza out of the circle and into the house proper so she can meet with Orodriel.  In an altered form, of course.  The two of them hit it off -- I think Ora is hungry for the kind of friendship she can't get from her ageing male tutors -- and K thinks Ora has great potential.  If she is to be an effective agent for me, then she is going to need more than literature and geography.

Also, it is time for a new tutor.  I will send Peotyr on his way and find another.  Fashrin will dispose of him somewhere on the road, of course.  The fewer people who know about this place the better.//

----

Summer 1140

//There have been many vists now, and we have taken the step of explaining to Ora the true nature of our monthly guest Khelekza.  Ora has been offered a companion of her own, D'Zal, whom she has also met over dinner.  She has even seen their true forms, which are quite beautiful when you get over the initial shock of how unhuman they are.

She must come into the bargain willingly for this to work over the long term.  But that doesn't mean I can't woo her with the possibilities.  She can visit many of the places she has only read about, and see the great cities of the world.  If she learns well enough, she will become my shadow, a hidden agent of my will.  She will go places and do things most girls from Thrace would hardly dream of.

Avadur continues to plague me.  No sooner had I ousted him from Lemonfall than he appeared at Newholy, in the service of my cousin.  Jamyt says he is too good a rider to throw away over my insecurities, but I can't help but think that boy will be the death of me.  The Duke favors him, I can tell that much.  He is naive and strong, a good combination in a servant if you can tolerate his coarse upbringing.//

----
Autumn 1140

//Ora is now possessed of D'Zal, and seems pleased.  They can speak mind-to-mind now, and I can tell when she is listening to her new "inner voice".  It might be my imagination, but she seems somehow stronger or more lively or more attractive now that she and D'Zal are together.  I can't quite put my finger on just what is different.

This year's tutor is working out well.  It will be a shame to have to kill her when her contract is up.//

----

//Ora, no doubt at D'Zal's suggestion, has killed a pair of travelers on the north road and made them her undead slaves.  She lured them to the house and killed them in their beds.  At first I was inclined to be angry, but she installed the wights in the empty crypt at the back entrance.  In time they will kill others, who will serve them, and we will have extra protection to call upon at need.//

----

//Leyana is pregnant.  Since I can't have bastards running around loose in Lemonfall I will put her up in a nice home in Turyr until she bears the child.  I will do for this child what I did for Ora.  It will be the third such offspring of mine, although none of them realize I am their father.//

----

//We have ogres.  The three of us talked about it for a while, and decided that Avadur would be the perfect person to get rid of them.  Hopefully he will die.  If not, we will make a present for him of a cursed thing that will be his downfall.//

----
Winter 1141

//Avadur has succeeded, which is something of a disappointment.  So we go on to the alternate plan, and commission a sword to celebrate his victory.  The smith promises me it will be exquisite.  I'll bring it here to have it cursed with a demon and then present it to him with great ceremony.//

----

//I think it was worth every coin I paid.  The sword is definitely possessed of the demon spirit just like the girl is, giving it magical powers -- it even shines with a bright light when drawn.  Avadur surely will not turn up his fat peasant nose at gift like this.  The demon within will weaken his will and, in time, come to control him.  He will perish and noone will be the wiser.  My only regret is that I will not see the event when it happens.//

----

//A forest troll tore into our shed and killed some sheep.  The whole building is ruined.  Fashrin will oversee the building of a replacement, perhaps ajoining the house itself.  We might as well get the roof rethatched while we're at it.

Ora disposed of the creature herself, which is quite the feat for a young woman.  I grow more pleased with my progeny by the day.  She animated the skeleton of the creature, and posted it at the back entrance.//
