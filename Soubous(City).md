title: City of Soubous
---



=Overview= 

Soubous is the single largest city in the known world, in almost every sense of the world. Once the center of an empire, all roads still lead here.  There are sights here that exist nowhere else: the Grand Prince's Court, the Imperial Playhouse, Sidir's Coliseum, the halfling [White Guard](White Guard.html) who personally guard the Grand Prince, the Avenue of Heroes, and many more.

The teeming, throbbing, stinking population once crowded within the immense city walls.  Now, there is considerably more room: several small sections of the city are abandoned, and some of the great monuments are decaying.  In spite of this, the city is still quite alive with people and culture. 

# Geography

Soubous sits squarely on the river Canamar, which flows north through Osotia and Voronia and into the sea.  The bend of the river here marks the closest point of trade between the river corridors of the Canamar and the [Yeron](Yeron.html). You can draw almost a straight line from Soubous in the West, through the desert and [Vohanis](Vohanis.html), and from thence to [Maedyn](Maedyn.html) in [Aspera](Aspera.html).  

Originally, the Canamar ran between several hills in a general south-to-north direction.  Over time, the area between the hills has been filled in to form the two major mounds of the city: the newer, southern mound is Palace Hill, where the business of the Principality takes place.  The river passes by on the west side of the hill, almost circles it, then turns north until it encounters the Library Mount, where it turns sharply west and flows around to encircle it and the Necropolis.

Besides the two great mounds, most of the rest of the city is relatively flat.  However, most of the city has been raised twice:  the current street level is about twenty-five feet above the original flood plain around the river.  Even the parks are several feet of soil, supported by the rooftops of ancient buildings.  Beneath the original layer of buildings is a thick strata of clay, which is what supports the riverbed, and beneath that is bedrock.

These old underpinnings of Soubous are commonly called the Undercity.  It is common for people to have access to the undercity from their homes and businesses.  They uses these spaces for storage and extra living space (although spring flooding can make that a hazardous business), and it isn't uncommon to keep passageways to one's friends and neighbors open instead of closing them off.  In other places, the undercity has collapsed and been filled in with rubble, and new buildings placed right on top of the unstable mess.

## The Necropolis

A huge portion of the city, about one seventh, is given over to the Necropolis.  It is a large-scale model of the city, sandwiched between the Canamar on west and the Library Mount on the east.  The people of the city cremate their loved ones and, depending on their means, place the urn somewhere in the Necropolis.  Necropolis buildings are owned by families or other social groups, and are usually in locations that mirror their places in life.  The royal family's ashes are interred in the New Palace, the Merchant Seaman's guild has a fine edifice by the blue-paved "river", and outer-city tenement buildings hold the ashes of generations.

Looking at the Necropolis is like seeing a mosaic of Soubous, where each tile comes from a different moment of time.  When buildings are added or rebuilt, they are often made to reflect the current city, and thus they remain indefinitely.  Harmonium architecture butts up comfortably against Imperialist Revival, while across the street huddles a knot of ancient circular stone huts that predate the city's walls.  Nearly all of the great buildings and monuments of the city are represented, as is much of the poor areas.

If a family acquires a building, or a building becomes crowded, it is considered bad form to simply toss out the old occupants.  To make room, the old occupants' ashes will be mixed with clay or other materials to become part of a repaired or expanded dwelling.  After being fired into his its new form, the object will be engraved with the identity and other particulars of the person it was made from.  Sometimes people will become planters, or bridges, or other decorative items instead of parts of buildings.  In the poorer areas in particular, the buildings are made almost entirely from the ashes of the dead.

Local superstition has it that the spirits of the dead awake during the new moon, and promenade through the Necropolis.  

# History

Soubous grew out of pastoral towns along the river, and dwarven settlements among the hills.  Like in other ancient cities, the oldest stonework here is the dwarven foundations and passageways carved into the hills.  The area remained chiefly pastoral throughout the elven Harmonium.

After the fall of the Harmonium and the desertification of the elf homelands, bands of humans warred with each other constantly.  The modestly fortified hilltop homes built by the dwarves became fortresses from which human warlords raided each other's fields.  The area remained at war with itself until one warlord conquered all seven hills, then crowned himself King Fadil.  During his reign, Soubous became a well-fortified city-state capable of fending off it's neighbors.  Fadil's ruthless dynasty lasted for over three hundred years.

## Mosyph

Soubous was at war with several nearby city-states when Mosyph burst onto the scene, killing five kings in the space of a day.  Overnight, Soubous became capital of a rapidly-expanding nation.  Over the course of the next few months, Mosyph extended his borders to roughly the bounds of today's Arducia.

Mosyph established a new power center on the southern group of hills, building a new palace, justice hall, and other stately edifices necessary to good government.  He turned the old palace into a library, and gave the north hills to his newly-established Academy of Mages.  This was to be the Academy's home until the founding of [Khum-Khari](Khum-Khari.html) decades later.  The Campus of Soubous still sits on those hills, the second-most-important Academy installation.

# Campus Personnel

## Director Magi Nazgol (Hu Fe)
The head of the campus. Her name means "cute flower", but this is a woman of considerable iron and temper. She is a ruthlessly efficient administrator, and knows how to cover her ass and protect her turf.  

## Assistant Director Blackstone (Dw Ma)
A faithful admin assistant with aspirations in the beuracracy. When Nazgol isn't available, he will typically be the one taking the messages.

## Apprentice Ordut (Hu Ma Wiz)
An apprentice serving in Nazgol's office.  He was the first on the scene after the council members were killed.

## Magi Soheil (Hu Ma)
Deputy Director of Enforcement, he reports to Nazgol.  His section is basically a bunch of wizard cops, who spend most of their time tracking down magical contraband, catching wizard lawbreakers, and supporting the City Watch when they want a wizard to back them up.

## Warden Furst (Hu Ma)
The warden isn't an arcanist, he's just the head gaoler of the Deeps.  He and his crew keep watch over the Academy prisoners with a noble indifference towards their health and sanity, seasoned with a touch of bored sadism.

## Arcanist Petrobasilla (Gn Ma Wiz/Exp)
A mostly-retired wizard who used to do various kinds of analysis for the Academy enforcers.  Now he runs an odd little shop near Palace Hill, called "Ink by the Dram", where he sells perfumes, inks, paper, and creates the odd alchemical solution once in a while.  Enthusiastic, rambling.  He is known among his friends less as a caster than as an excellent store or arcane knowledge.

# Notable Nobles

## Lord Marshall Youseph (Hu Ma Fi/No)
A favored son of Djazef's line, this is an eminently connected personage.  He is a life-long military man, having given the majority of his years into the service of his cousin the Grand Prince.  He is one of the great lords of Arducia, and has a reputation for ambition and callousness.

## Sharban (Colonel) Griffith (Hu Ma Fi)
Griffith is one of hundreds of men of noble name who have no birthright, thanks to the inheritance laws.  His enthusiasm, valor, and sense of honor are second to none.  Although technically a military man, he has spent the last few years as the head of city watch.

# Others

## Samud, a scribbler of tales
Round-faced, portly, and cheery, Samud spends his money as fast as he can make it.  It is a good thing that he makes an exceptional income from the stories he writes for the local papers.  When he is not writing, he can often be found in salons, pubs, inns, bordelloes, attending plays, operas, sporting events, gambling, or generally cavorting.
