title: Te and the Formation of As-Perod
---

When the gods saw that the Fey would not worship them they agreed to make a new land and put into it more devoted followers.  But they could not agree on how to proceed, and they argued.  Each took hold of the elements and tried to shape the new land as they saw fit, each one unmaking the others' work.  After many days of this argument the new land was formless chaos and nothing could live there.  In mutual anger, they smashed the world into tiny pieces and left it to drink wine and decide how better to proceed.

Te saw her children bickering, and when they had gone she took some of the ruined work into her hands hands and ate it.  She did this three times, until she had eaten all of it.  Afterwards she became pregnant, and swelled to alarming proportions.  She gave birth first to the rivers and the plains and the mountains, everything from the [[Yeron|Great River]] to the Far Sea.  After that was done she gave birth again, this time to the plants and animals that live in the land.  

The other gods returned to find As-Perod already formed, so each set about populating the land with their own special peoples and other creatures as they desired.  They made the new people on the west banks of the river, breathed life into them, and set them loose to explore.  For a time the people gathered by the river and would not disperse, so the gods evicted them and confused their languages.

After the other gods had finished their work, Te gave birth again.  This time, she brought forth the twins, Heironeous and Hextor.  Exhausted from her labors, Te laid down by the river and slept.
