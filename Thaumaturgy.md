title: Thaumaturgy
---

Thaumaturgy is the magical force that connects all things together, especially things that are like each other.  The element of fire intrinsic in a pinch of sulfur helps an arcanist evoke it in far larger amounts.  The memory of flight in a feather connects the caster to the essence of flight itself.  Scrying spells are much improved by the addition of a lock of hair from the subject.  

But thaumaturgy is a very weak force.  It connects, but it does not empower.  It associates, but does not control.  It is a necessary part of almost any magic but you could not, for example, create a magic device that was purely thaumaturgical.  Telepathy stones, a recent invention, are as close as we are likely get to such a pure device.  Any magic that **does** something must depend mainly on non-thaumaturgical forces.
