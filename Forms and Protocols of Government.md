title: Forms and Protocols of Government
---

Oquai's **Forms and Protocols of Government**, aka "the Protocols", is required reading for nobility in [[Aspera]].  It was written during the reformation to define governmental structure, unify state proceedings of all kinds, and clarify important points of etiquette.  New editions are printed as needed, roughly every five or six years.  The latest edition was edited and revised by Ferrule Lighthammer.

Perhaps a third of "Protocols" is filled with essential wisdom, advice, and examples on how to handle common problems.  Usually these parable-like stories end in an aphorism like "corruption thrives in darkness," "the good steward improves his lot," "greed is a double-edged blade," and "a common enemy binds people together".

The cover of "Protocols" varies from one edition to the next, but always features interlocking rings.  It is the companion volume to [[Land Management]].
