# Ghaucia
1015 BCE - 225 CE

Born to an elven tribe in what is now the high desert, Ghaucia journeyed far and wide in his youth seeking knowledge.  By the relatively young age of 400, he had learned all of the secret martial arts of the Elven masters.  By the more respectable age of 850, he had also become a powerful sorcerer.  He set aside both pursuits to engage in the arts, mostly working in colored glass.  He was often heard to say that art was the highest pursuit of any intelligent creature.  It was therefore ironic that he would spend the last two centuries of his life fighting for the empire by sword and magic.

Early in his 10-year conquest of As-Perod, [Mosyph](Mosyph.html) approached the elves demanding that they submit to his rule.  Furthermore, he promised to forgo any claim of military service by their sons if they would give him but one man, Ghaucia.  Reluctantly, Ghaucia pledged to serve the Empire for as long as it was ruled by Mosyph's blood.  Many elves, eager to fight next the already-legendary figures of Ghaucia and Mosyph, volunteered for Ghaucia's new army.

In the 10-year conquest Ghaucia and his legions were best remembered  for bottling up the [Releven](Releven.html) halflings for over two years, using vastly inferior forces that were poorly supplied.  Doing so deprived the middle kingdoms of a much needed ally at little cost, and tilted the war heavily to Mosyph's favor.  This feat ultimately led to the founding of the [White Guard](White Guard.html).

After the conquest, Ghaucia remained with the Red Emperor throughout his rein and commanded his armies during the [Seosur War](Seosur War.html).  After Mosyph's death he served the new Emperor [Exxis](Exxis.html), and then his son [Sidir](Sidir.html).  He found great disfavor with the so-called Golden Emperor, and was demoted from a trusted marshal to a lowly batallion commander.  

With the appearance of the Veil, Ghaucia was instrumental in rescuing the gnomish people from Monadran before they were pushed en-masse into the sea.  He brought them to As-Perod, where they became the diaspora they are today.

With the Empire out of the hands of [Mosyph](Mosyph.html)'s offspring, Sidir lost among the Fey in Gon-Perod (and presumed dead since Qayyan's reappearance) and his health failing, Ghaucia laid down his sword spent his last years submerged in artwork.

## Founding the Academy

Ghaucia helped to found the [Arcane Academy](Arcane Academy.html), and was its first Chancellor.  The initial home of the Academy was the Old Palace in [Soubous(City)](Soubous(City).html). After the 10-Year Conquest, but before the [Seosur Wars](Seosur Wars.html), he and the other Mage Lords began work on [Khum-Khari](Khum-Khari.html).  The "City of Towers", as it is often called today, has been the home of the Academy ever since.
