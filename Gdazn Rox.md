# The Kobold Settlement of Gdazn Rox

Perched near the top of the Urnsula Descent, this unlikely trading post is home to several hundred permanent kobold residents, plus an untold number of transients and a smattering of ogres, trolls, goblinoids, and the occasional humanoid.  It is the only place to trade for over a hundred miles in any direction, and perhaps the only mixed non-humanoid settlement anywhere.

That this trading post has remained unassailed for so long is a minor miracle.  It might have something to do with the disastrous [War of Indignation](War of Indignation.html) which ended in 1130, and so weakened all the desert-dwelling races that conflict has become pointless.  There is plenty of room left for everyone still living.

The settlement is located in a pass between two hills.  The eastern hill has a sheer rock face riddled with narrow walkways and kobold-sized holes used for shelter.  The western hill is more gracefully slopped, and populated at random intervals with crude lean-toes and sloppily built shelters of mostly wood.  A few stone buildings stand out among them.  In between is the main road through town, and the bazaar.  The entire affair is maybe 200 yards square.

## Palisade and Gates

At the north and south sides of town are palisades which block the road and the pass.  The palisades are hardly worth the name.  They are only 10' high and look weak enough to be pulled down with a rope and a horse.  Kobolds with crossbows patrol the walkways at the top of the palisades, while two ogres and several kobolds guard the gates below.

Each palisade has a single gate.  Everyone who enters is required to pay a silver piece and give up their weapons, except for knives under six inches and staffs.  The ogres aren't present to guard the gate so much as to guard the huge weapons lockers where deposited weapons are kept.  

Some people who object to handing over their weapons will be allowed to bind them, but only if they are from cultures that the kobolds know will honor the binding.  Elves can use braided locks of their own hair, and Asperian knights may use hair from their warhorses.  Other exceptions exist for the Skullcrusher ogres and dwarves.

The northern gate has an excellent view of the Descent, with the marsh forming a shimmering green line on the horizon.

## Bazaar

The bazaar is at first glance shabby and wretched.  People (mostly kobolds) pay a few coppers to simply lay their goods down on the ground, sometimes on blankets or makeshift tables, and hawk their wares.  Uncured meats, wood, fruits and plants from the swamp, iron ten-krones, other metals, armor, and weapons are all available.  

Silver is far more plentiful here than gold, and large sales are typically paid for in stacks of silver krones.  When a large amount of money is called for, security ogres are used to fetch the krones from the vaults carved deep into the hillside.  Ogres are useful for this task because they are strong enough to carry large loads, and too stupid to steal without getting caught.

## Hillside

### Cave of Wonders

One of the few well-constructed entrances into the hillside is 10' high (large enough for ogres) and the adjoining rock face is painted with the words "Cave of Wonders" in several languages.  A kobold outside the arched doorway tries to convince passers-by to pay a silver coin to enter.  He knows phrases like "Cave of Wonders", "Many wonderful things", and "You think amazing" in six languages.  

Inside is a natural cavern with some interesting geological features, sparkly walls, a statue of a kobold hero, various kobold propaganda murals, and finally a partially excavated skeleton of what must of been an ancient wyrm. The plaque says "This is Jaugua the Magnificent, ruler of these parts long ago. He devoured all who stood before him." There is stall at the exit selling copper medallions stamped with Jagua's name and supposed likeness, and some rocks that glow in the dark.

## Shanty Town

### Sleeping Dragon

For people who don't want to just kip in the open on the hillside, there is the Sleeping Dragon.  It is mostly just a common room where meals are served, and at night customers lay out their bedrolls to sleep.  The beer isn't very good, but some people can drink it.  The outer doors are heavy and lock tight.  Two copper a night buys space on the common room floor and a barely digestible meal.  

### Goods by Corinth

Although not the largest stone building in the shantytown, this is definitely the best-built.  Corinth Deepforge, a dwarf of advancing years, runs this establishment with the help of his two sons and a few human assistants.  The prices of "normal goods" elsewhere are 10% higher here, while certain more exotic goods native to the area are considerably cheaper.  

He longs for the company and news of his own kind, and will gladly reduce his prices to normal for a fellow dwarf.  If asked why he runs a store so far out in the wild, he'll say that unusual opportunities often crop up here that you can't find anywhere else.

### Nibbs Books and Maps

Flanitolius "Nibbs" Phelitidean is a gnome who built his store almost as soon as Gdazn Rox was established.  He and his staff of gnomes and kobolds make most of their money from copying and translating draconic writings.  Kobolds revere dragons, and those who can read will buy as many draconic works as he can provide.  Even those who can't read want to claim one or two copies.

Nibbs is also a cartographer who collects any data he can get about the surrounding area to improve his regional maps.  He knows the location of all the major towns and roads of western [Ild-Eldir](Ild-Eldir.html) that have been swallowed by the marshlands, and he can copy out useful maps in a matter of hours (for a fee).

Occasionally, travelers and treasure hunters will find spellbooks or other magical writings.  These he keeps for the academy, which pays a nice bounty for such found items.

### Gem Exchange

The single largest building in the shantytown, the Exchange is build like a crude but effective fortress.  It relies mostly on sheer thickness to deter attackers.  Buyers are allowed to examine raw gemstones here, dug up from various mines in the hills.  Diamonds, rubies, sapphires, quartz and garnets are the most common gems.  A skilled buyer can obtain gems here for one-quarter their finished price.
